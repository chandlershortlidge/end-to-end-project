Association between subway iron particulate matter exposure and respiratory disease in New York City.,"Particulate matter exposure is linked to increased morbidity and mortality. Iron-rich particulate matter (PM2.5), common in rapid transit systems, is a potential but understudied contributor to respiratory illness. Using electronic health records (EHR) from 452,272 patients in the INSIGHT Clinical Research Network in New York City (2020-2023), we examined whether local iron exposure is associated with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), breathing difficulties, or respiratory inhaler use. Iron exposure was estimated using particulate matter measurements from New York City (NYC) subway stations, linked to each patients residential census block group. To account for potential non-linear relationships, we applied linear probability models and an adjacent block group estimator with paired fixed effects to assess respiratory outcomes across deciles of iron exposure. We found that the relative risk of developing asthma, COPD, or breathing difficulties increased by 6-15% between the lowest two exposure deciles. Beyond this range, there was no significant association between iron exposure and respiratory disease. This suggests that iron exposure from rapid transit is associated with respiratory disease primarily at lower exposure levels, with limited health benefits from marginal reductions in iron exposure at already high exposure levels."
Cancer incidence and proximity to coal ash impoundments in the United States.,"Across the United States (U.S.), many communities experience disproportionate exposure to environmental health hazards due to their proximity to coal-fired power plants and associated coal ash disposal sites. These facilities release toxic heavy metals such as arsenic, mercury, and lead into the surrounding environment, posing serious public health risks. Although prior research has documented adverse health effects of coal-fired power plants, few studies have specifically examined the relationship between cancer incidence and proximity to coal ash impoundments, as well as exposure to elevated concentrations of toxic constituents in coal ash. Using complementary contingency table analyses, bivariate spatial association techniques, and spatial regression methods, this study finds consistent evidence that counties containing or adjacent to coal ash impoundments exhibit significantly higher cancer incidence rates compared to more distant counties, even after adjusting for potential confounders. Incidence rates for both total cancer and lung cancer were significantly associated with smoking, drinking, and physical inactivity, corroborating prior research on these behavioral risk factors. The lung cancer model further revealed significant positive associations between cancer incidence and PM₂.₅, arsenic concentrations, and airborne cancer risk scores, highlighting specific environmental risk factors for the disease. These findings strengthen the evidence linking coal ash exposure to adverse health outcomes and underscore the urgent need for robust enforcement and compliance measures to protect communities from coal ash contamination."
Outdoor air pollutants and asthma risk in adolescents: evidence from a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Existing epidemiological evidence linking outdoor air pollution to asthma incidence in adolescents remains inconclusive, due to methodological heterogeneity in study design, exposure assessment, and asthma case definitions. This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized observational studies examining associations between outdoor air pollutants and adolescent asthma. Comprehensive searches of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were conducted using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and free-text terms. Eligible studies reported quantitative estimates, odds ratio (OR), hazard ratio (HR), relative risk (RR), prevalence ratio (PR), incidence rate ratio (IRR), or prevalence odds ratio (POR), with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Pooled estimates were calculated using inverse-variance weighted fixed- and random-effects models. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's  Of 51 eligible studies, 40 were incorporated into the meta-analysis. Statistically significant associations were identified for each 10 μg/m This meta-analysis highlights significant associations between adolescent asthma and specific combustion-related air pollutants. Future research should prioritize standardized exposure metrics, life-course cohort designs, and multipollutant modeling to inform targeted prevention and public health strategies. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier PROSPERO database (CRD42024622246)."
Airway transcriptome networks for ozone and PM,"Air pollution disproportionately affects individuals with asthma, triggering asthma exacerbations and morbidity. We hypothesized that children with and without asthma have distinct airway transcriptome networks associated with ozone and particulate matter ≤ 2.5 µm (PM We recruited children from the New York metropolitan area, mapped their air pollutant exposures, and collected nasal and bronchial samples for transcriptome and cellular profiling. We used causal network construction and key driver analyses to build airway transcriptome networks for ozone and PM The cohort included 307 children, including 167 (54.4%) with asthma and 140 (45.6%) without asthma. The mean age was 13.4 years (SD 4.4 years). Among children with asthma, the airway causal network and its key drivers represented pro-inflammatory adaptive immune processes. Six key driver transcripts for ozone (CLC, CPA3, FGL2, LGALS12, IL7R, HRH4) and three key driver transcripts for PM Children with and without asthma have very distinct causal networks and key drivers for ozone and PM"
Quantifying the effect of air pollution and temperature on hospitalization costs for chronic lower respiratory diseases.,"Environmental exposure is a crucial factor contributing to the increasing health and economic burden of chronic lower respiratory diseases (CLRDs). This study aims to quantify the effects of environmental exposure on hospitalization costs associated with CLRDs and their population heterogeneity, thus providing a scientific basis for formulating more precise and effective cost-control policies. Hospital admission records from seven major tertiary hospitals in Changchun from 2017 to 2020 were collected, as were environmental monitoring and meteorological data. A generalized additive model and distributed lag nonlinear model were employed to identify the exposure-response relationships and lag effects of pollutants and temperature. A total of 23,569 patients with CLRDs were included. Most of the participants were male (50.83%) and aged 60 years and older (63.42%), with hospitalization costs accounting for 54.22 and 67.96% of total costs, respectively. When the concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO A significant association was observed between increased air pollutant concentrations and the hospitalization costs of patients with CLRDs, with heterogeneity among different populations. Specifically, the effects of SO"
Greater ambient air pollution exposure is associated with worse respiratory symptoms in men and women with HIV and chronic lung disease: a cohort study.,"COPD and impairment in diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) are common comorbidities in people with HIV (PWH). HIV may increase susceptibility to inhaled toxins including air pollution. In PWH and people without HIV (PWoH), we investigated whether air pollution exposure was associated with within-group differences in lung function or respiratory symptoms, and whether these associations differed by HIV serostatus or the presence of underlying lung disease. We analyzed cross-sectional data from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) and the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), including participants with pulmonary function tests and accompanying standardized respiratory questionnaires in 2017–2020. The participants were linked to fine particulate matter (PM 338 MACS participants and 1073 WIHS participants were included. Overall, there were no significant associations between pollution exposures and either lung function or respiratory symptoms.

Caspase-1 Dependent Neutrophil Pyroptosis Contributes to Fine Particulate Matter-Induced Lung Inflammation.,"As a pollutant, Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) directly deposits in alveoli to induce lung inflammation, yet its pathogenic mechanism remains unclear. PM2.5-induced pulmonary inflammation will trigger the activation of Caspase-1 (Casp1). We seek to elucidate the role of pyroptosis in PM2.5-induced lung inflammation by employing Casp1 knock-out (KO) mice and a specific pyroptosis inhibitor (Disulfiram, DSF). We found the typical pathological changes were comparatively alleviated in the Casp1 KO mice. Notably, in Casp1 KO mice, there was a significant downregulation of gasdermin D (GSDMD) and GSDMD-N at the protein levels. The Casp1 KO mice exhibited a decrease in the numbers of pyroptotic neutrophils. After administrating with DSF, we observed the downregulation of GSDMD and GSDMD-N, along with a decreased number of pyroptotic neutrophils. These findings suggest that neutrophils contribute to PM2.5-induced lung inflammation depending on Caspase-1/pyroptosis signaling pathway. These results demonstrate that PM2.5 triggers lung inflammation via the neutrophil Caspase-1/pyroptosis pathway, revealing a novel mechanism of PM2.5-mediated inflammation and suggesting DSF as a potential therapeutic agent for PM2.5-induced pneumonia."
Associations of Early Life Ambient PM,"To examine whether exposure to fine particulate matter (PM We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 337 infants with BPD, born between 2010 and 2019, who survived to discharge with clinical follow-up in the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Care Network through age 5.

Spatiotemporal patterns of asthma in Bhutan: a Bayesian analysis.,"Asthma is a chronic respiratory disorder requiring ongoing medical management. This ecological study investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of notification rates for asthma from clinic visits and hospital discharges and identified demographic, meteorological and environmental factors that drive asthma in Bhutan. Monthly numbers of asthma notifications from 2016 to 2022 were obtained from the Bhutan Ministry of Health. Climatic variables (rainfall, relative humidity, minimum and maximum temperature) were obtained from the National Centre for Hydrology and Meteorology, Bhutan. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and surface particulate matter (PM2.5) were extracted from open sources. A multivariable zero-inflated Poisson regression (ZIP) model was developed in a Bayesian framework to quantify the relationship between risk of asthma and sociodemographic and environmental correlates, while also identifying the underlying spatial structure of the data. There were 12 696 asthma notifications, with an annual average prevalence of 244/100 000 population between 2016 and 2022. In ZIP analysis, asthma notifications were 3.4 times (relative risk (RR)=3.39; 95% credible interval (CrI) 3.047 to 3.773) more likely in individuals aged >14 years than those aged ≤14 years, and 43% (RR=1.43; 95% CrI 36.5% to 49.2%) more likely for females than males. Asthma notification increased by 0.8% (RR=1.008, 95% CrI 0.2% to 1.5%) for every 10 cm increase in rainfall, and 1.7% (RR=1.017; 95% CrI 1.2% to 2.3%) for a 1°C increase in maximum temperature. An increase in one unit of NDVI and 10 µg/m Environmental risk factors and spatial clusters of asthma notifications were identified. Identification of spatial clusters and environmental risk factors can help develop targeted interventions that maximise impact of limited public health resources for controlling asthma in Bhutan."
Wildfire smoke and pediatric asthma control in the Northeastern United States: a cross-sectional study.,"Poor air quality due to smoke from distant wildfires is a growing risk for the Northeastern United States, a region largely unaffected by these events until recently. Despite this emerging threat, few studies have examined the effect of wildfire smoke on respiratory health in this region. We investigated the association between wildfire smoke exposure and pediatric asthma control in Vermont and upstate New York. We extracted data from the electronic health records of youth aged 3-21 years diagnosed with asthma within a single regional healthcare system and included three clinical measures of asthma control: Test for Respiratory and Asthma Control in Kids (3-4 years), Asthma Therapy Assessment Questionnaire (5-21 years), and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) asthma control guidelines (3-21 years). We first compared asthma control in the smoke-affected summer of 2023 to the largely unaffected summers of 2022 and 2024 using regression models, controlling for pollen exposure. We then obtained airborne particulate matter (PM The study sample included 1,217 encounters (mean age 9.1 ± 4.4 years, 57% male). Asthma control was significantly worse in the severely smoke-affected summer of 2023 versus 2022 for two of the three clinical measures but was not different between 2023 and 2024 for any of the clinical measures. Within summer 2023, there were no significant associations between ZIP code-level PM Wildfire smoke exposure in the Northeast was associated with decreased asthma control in this pediatric population, though not consistently across years and all clinical measures. As climate change drives longer and more intense wildfire seasons, continued monitoring is needed to understand the impact on pediatric respiratory health in this historically low-exposed region."
Wildfire-related PM2.5 and respiratory transmitted disease among Chinese children and adolescents from 2008 to 2019: A retrospective study.,"Exposure to fine particles (PM2.5) from wildfires is known to cause deaths and chronic diseases, but its effect on respiratory infections, especially in children and adolescents, is not well characterized. We aimed to comprehensively assess the association between short-term exposure to wildfire-related PM2.5 and the incidence and mortality of respiratory transmitted diseases in children and adolescents. Data on daily counts of incident and mortality cases of respiratory transmitted diseases in persons aged 4-24 years old were collected from China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention, covering 501 cities from 2008 to 2019. Daily concentrations of wildfire-related PM2.5 were estimated using machine learning and chemical transport models at a 0.25°×0.25° spatial resolution. We used time-stratified case-crossover design with conditional logistic regression to estimate the association between short-term exposures to wildfire-related PM2.5 and incidence and mortality of respiratory transmitted diseases, adjusting for temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, and total PM2.5. There were 6,089,271 incident cases and 1,034 mortality cases of 10 respiratory transmitted diseases included in our analyses. Each 5 μg/m3 increase in the lag 0-28-day (average of current day and previous 28 days) for wildfire-related PM2.5 was associated with a 6.8% (95%CI: 5.0%, 8.7%) increase in the daily incidence rate of respiratory transmitted diseases, which is greater than that of a 1.2% (1.0%, 1.4%) increase associated with the same increase of non-wildfire-related PM2.5. A 5 μg/m3 increase in wildfire-related PM2.5 was associated with a 28.6% (21.0%, 36.8%), 5.2% (2.3%, 8.3%), 12.6% (9.5%, 15.8%), and 13.6% (5.6%, 22.2%) increase in the incidence of seasonal influenza, scarlet fever, rubella, and measles, respectively. Although wildfire-related PM2.5 constitutes only 2.7% of the total PM2.5, it contributes significantly to respiratory transmitted diseases, accounting for 10.8% of all PM2.5-associated cases. In areas where the annual concentration of wildfire-related PM2.5 is lower than 1.5 μg/m3, the proportion of cases associated with wildfire-related PM2.5 reached 29.7%. Study limitations include potential exposure misclassification from using city-average wildfire PM2.5 as a proxy for individual exposure and an inability to adjust for some potential confounders. Short-term exposure to wildfire-related PM2.5 was associated with increased incidence of respiratory transmitted diseases, surpassing the impact observed with non-wildfire-related PM2.5. This phenomenon is not restricted to regions with high pollutant concentrations; even populations residing in areas with lower concentrations of wildfire-related PM2.5 are at an increased risk of these respiratory conditions. Consequently, there emerges a pressing global imperative to confront the escalating challenges presented by climate change and the intensifying menace of wildfires."
Study on the health impacts of childhood asthma in China caused by air pollution.,"Asthma is one of the major disease burdens in children. Ambient air pollution is associated with the prevalence and exacerbation of childhood asthma. Over recent decades, China has exhibited a persistent upward trajectory in pediatric asthma prevalence. This epidemiological trend necessitates a comprehensive evaluation of the health impacts associated with childhood asthma attributable to ambient air pollution exposure. This study selected PM2.5, NO2, and O3 as representative ambient air pollutants in China, and obtained exposure-response parameters required for health impact assessment through Meta-analysis. Then the study evaluated the health impacts of childhood asthma aged 0-14 years attributable to air pollution in 336 cities across China based on national real-time air quality monitoring data. Hypothetical scenarios were also constructed to predict the preventable childhood asthma disease burden under different air pollution control levels. The results showed that in 2019, air pollution caused 264,800-467,100 childhood asthma exacerbation cases and 622,800-1115,000 incident asthma cases among children, accounting for 7.1% - 12.5% and 31.4% - 56.2% of the total asthma children visits and incidence of childhood asthma in that year. The pollutant that has the greatest impact on childhood asthma is O3, followed by PM2.5 and NO2. The health impacts of the three pollutants were spatially distributed to be higher in the central and southern regions of China, and lower in the southwestern, northeastern, and northwestern regions. Chongqing was the city most affected by three types of pollutants. When pollutant concentrations comply with the WHO guidelines, up to 267,900 cases of childhood asthma exacerbations and 873,900 new-onset childhood asthma cases could be averted."
Impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on air pollution in Tbilisi.,"The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown provided a unique opportunity to assess the effects of mobility restrictions on urban air pollution. Prior studies have shown that scale and impact of these reductions varied by location and time. This study assessed how daily concentrations of PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ changed during 2020 lockdown compared to the same period in 2019 and 2021, and evaluated how these levels aligned with the updated WHO Air Quality Guidelines and Georgia's national standards. Daily average concentrations of PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ were analyzed over a 63-day period (March 21 to May 22) for 2019, 2020, and 2021. Descriptive statistics, ANOVA, and pairwise post-hoc tests were used to assess changes. Exceedance rates for WHO guidelines and Georgian standards were also calculated to evaluate compliance. Average daily concentrations of PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ declined modestly during the 2020 lockdown compared to pre-lockdown 2019, but increased significantly post-lockdown in 2021. PM₂.₅ increased from 11.7 µg/m3 in 2020 to 14.6 µg/m3 in 2021 (p = 0.010); PM₁₀ increased from 23.2 µg/m3 to 32.3 µg/m3 (p = 0.001). The proportion of days exceeding WHO values was lowest in 2020 for both PM₂.₅ (23.3%) and PM₁₀ (5.0%) but increased in 2021. Exceedances of Georgian standards remained minimal across all years. The lockdown was associated with a temporary decline in PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ in Tbilisi, however, levels increased again in 2021, with more frequent exceedances of WHO guidelines. The consistently low exceedance under Georgia's national standards highlights the urgency of revising thresholds and strengthening long-term air quality policies."
Air pollution and health of working-age population: Evidence from thermal inversion.,"Despite the significant impact of air pollution on public health, its causal effects on a national scale have not been extensively studied. In this paper, we examine the impact of PM2.5 on adult health in the United States using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System for 2001-2012, focusing on a period of relatively low pollution levels. To address the endogeneity issue, we use the two-stage least squares regression with thermal inversion as an instrumental variable. Our findings provide evidence of the ongoing negative impact of air pollution on overall health. In particular, we find that a 1 µg/m"
Health effects of wildfire PM2.5 in Latin American cities: A rapid systematic review and comparative synthesis.,"Wildfire activity is intensifying in Latin America due to climate and land-use changes, but the health impacts of wildfire-derived PM2.5 in urban areas remain poorly quantified and recognized. To assess the evidence on wildfire-related PM2.5 and its association with mortality and morbidity in Latin American cities. We conducted a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines, using data from PubMed, Scopus, and Bireme. One reviewer independently screened 163 articles and extracted data from 14 eligible studies. A risk of bias assessment was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Most studies were conducted in Brazil (n = 12) and used time-series or modelling designs to estimate health risks. Wildfire-specific PM2.5 exposure was associated with allcause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality. Reported effect estimates ranged from 1.7 to 7.7% increases in risk per 10 μg/m³ of exposure. Other studies assessed preterm birth, COVID-19 outcomes, and site-specific cancers. While two studies provided harmonized RR estimates for all-cause mortality, high heterogeneity and methodological differences prevented formal meta-analysis. Wildfire smoke contributes measurably to premature mortality in Latin America, but current evidence is unevenly distributed across regions, time periods, and population subgroups. Studies rarely capture the disproportionate risks faced by indigenous and rural communities or the intraurban disparities linked to poverty and geography. Future research should focus on the health burden of morbidity linked to wildfire PM2.5. La actividad de incendios forestales se está intensificando en América Latina debido al cambio climático y al uso del suelo, pero los impactos en la salud del material particulado fino (PM2.5) derivado de estos incendios en áreas urbanas siguen estando poco cuantificados y reconocidos. Evaluar la evidencia sobre el PM2.5 relacionado con incendios forestales y su asociación con la mortalidad y morbilidad en ciudades latinoamericanas. Se realizó una revisión sistemática rápida y un metaanálisis siguiendo las directrices PRISMA, utilizando datos de PubMed, Scopus y BIREME. Un revisor examinó de forma independiente 163 artículos y extrajo datos de 14 estudios elegibles. Se llevó a cabo una evaluación del riesgo de sesgo utilizando la escala de Newcastle–Ottawa. La mayoría de los estudios se realizaron en Brasil (n=12) y emplearon diseños de series temporales o modelos para estimar los riesgos para la salud. La exposición a PM2.5 específico de incendios se asoció con mortalidad por todas las causas, cardiovascular y respiratoria. Las estimaciones de efecto reportadas oscilaron entre aumentos del 1.7% al 7.7% en el riesgo por cada incremento de 10 µg/m³ de exposición. Otros estudios evaluaron parto prematuro, desenlaces por COVID-19 y cánceres específicos por sitio. Aunque dos estudios proporcionaron estimaciones armonizadas de riesgo relativo para la mortalidad por todas las causas, la alta heterogeneidad y las diferencias metodológicas impidieron realizar un meta-análisis formal. El humo de incendios forestales contribuye de manera significativa a la mortalidad prematura en América Latina, pero la evidencia actual está distribuida de forma desigual entre regiones, períodos de tiempo y subgrupos poblacionales. Rara vez se capturan los riesgos desproporcionados que enfrentan las comunidades indígenas y rurales, o las disparidades intraurbanas vinculadas a la pobreza y la geografía. Las investigaciones futuras deberían centrarse en la carga de morbilidad asociada al PM2.5 de incendios forestales."
Divergent trends and regional disparities in PM,"Utilizing China's air quality monitoring data from 2013 to 2023, this study employs spatial autocorrelation analysis and health impact assessment methodologies to quantify the health economic costs and temporal trends of PM"
[PM2.5-induced M2 Polarization and IL-1α Secretion by Tumor-associated Macrophages Promotes Lung Adenocarcinoma Progression].,"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains one of the leading causes of cancer morbidity and mortality worldwide, and its initiation and progression are closely associated with the tumor immune microenvironment. Increasing evidence suggests that environmental exposure is a critical factor influencing lung cancer development. Among these factors, fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a major component of air pollution, has been strongly linked to elevated lung cancer risk and unfavorable prognosis. However, the underlying immunoregulatory mechanisms by which PM2.5 drives LUAD progression remain poorly understood. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), especially those polarized toward the M2 phenotype, are key components of the tumor microenvironment and play crucial roles in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and immune evasion. This study aims to investigate the effects of PM2.5 exposure on TAMs and to identify the key pro-tumorigenic factors mediating this process. A mouse orthotopic lung cancer model under PM2.5 exposure was established to assess lung tumor growth and macrophage phenotypic alterations using in vivo imaging and flow cytometry. A subcutaneous tumor model involving co-inoculated macrophages and tumor cells was used to further verify the effects of PM2.5 on the function of TAMs and tumor malignancy. Combining in vitro experiments, flow cytometry, Western blot, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation assay, and wound healing assay were employed to evaluate the regulatory effects of PM2.5 on the polarization of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) as well as tumor cell proliferation, migration, and colony-forming ability. Transcriptome sequencing integrated with TISIDB (Tumor-immune System Interactions Database) and GEPIA (Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis) databases was performed to identify key cytokines for further functional validation. In the mouse orthotopic lung cancer model, PM2.5 exposure significantly promoted tumor growth and increased the proportion of M2-type TAMs (P<0.05). Subcutaneous co-inoculation with PM2.5-treated BMDMs markedly enhanced tumor proliferation and elevated the intratumoral M2-type TAMs. PM2.5-pretreated BMDMs exhibited an immunosuppressive programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)+/arginase 1 (Arg1)+ phenotype, and their conditioned media significantly promoted proliferation, migration, and colony formation of Lewis lung carcinoma cells (LLC) and B16 melanoma cells (B16) (P<0.05). Transcriptome analysis revealed that PM2.5 substantially altered macrophage gene expression, with IL-1α identified as a key upregulated secreted cytokine enriched in immunosuppressive related signaling pathways. Clinical database analyses further indicated that IL-1α expression was positively correlated with macrophage and regulatory T cells (Treg) infiltration in the LUAD immune microenvironment, and that high IL-1α expression was associated with worse overall survival in LUAD patients (HR=1.5, P=0.0053). Western blot, RT-qPCR, and immunofluorescence confirmed that PM2.5 exposure significantly upregulated IL-1α expression and secretion in TAMs. PM2.5 exposure facilitates LUAD progression by inducing an immunosuppressive phenotype in macrophages and enhancing the malignant behaviors of tumor cells. Mechanistically, IL-1α may serve as a key pro-tumorigenic cytokine secreted by macrophages under PM2.5 exposure. This study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of PM2.5-associated LUAD and suggests that IL-1α could serve as a potential therapeutic target. 【中文题目：PM2.5暴露通过诱导肿瘤相关巨噬细胞M2极化及IL-1α的分泌促进肺腺癌进展的机制研究】 【中文摘要：背景与目的 肺腺癌（lung adenocarcinoma, LUAD）是全球发病率和死亡率均居前列的恶性肿瘤，其发生发展与肿瘤免疫微环境密切相关。近年来，大量研究表明，环境暴露因素在LUAD发生中具有重要作用，其中细颗粒物（PM2.5）作为空气污染的主要成分之一，已被证实与肺癌发病风险增加及预后不良密切相关。然而，PM2.5如何通过调控肿瘤免疫微环境促进LUAD进展的分子机制尚不清楚。肿瘤相关巨噬细胞（tumor-associated macrophages, TAMs），尤其是M2型巨噬细胞，在肿瘤生长、血管生成及免疫逃逸中起关键作用。本研究旨在探讨PM2.5暴露是否通过重塑TAMs功能促进LUAD进展，并筛选关键促癌因子。方法 本研究首先构建PM2.5暴露的小鼠原位肺癌模型，采用活体成像技术和流式细胞术分析肺部肿瘤生长及巨噬细胞表型变化。其次，通过巨噬细胞与肿瘤细胞共接种构建皮下移植瘤模型，进一步验证PM2.5对TAMs功能及肿瘤恶性行为的影响。结合体外细胞实验，运用流式细胞术、Western blot、逆转录定量聚合酶链反应（reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, RT-qPCR）、细胞增殖试验（cell counting kit-8, CCK-8）、克隆形成及划痕实验，评估PM2.5对骨髓来源巨噬细胞（bone marrow-derived macrophage, BMDMs）表型及肿瘤细胞增殖、迁移与克隆形成能力的调控作用。最后，通过转录组测序并结合TISIDB（Tumor-immune System Interactions Database）、GEPIA（Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis）等公共数据库进行生物信息学分析，筛选关键细胞因子并进行功能验证。结果 小鼠原位肺癌模型显示，PM2.5暴露可显著促进肺癌生长，并增加M2型TAMs比例（P<0.05）。皮下移植瘤模型显示，共接种PM2.5处理的BMDMs可明显促进肿瘤细胞增殖，且瘤内M2型TAMs比例上调。PM2.5预处理的BMDMs呈现程序性细胞死亡配体1（programmed cell death ligand 1, PD-L1）+、精氨酸酶1（arginase 1, ARG1）+免疫抑制表型，其条件培养基显著增强Lewis肺癌细胞（Lewis lung carcinoma, LLC）和黑色素瘤细胞（B16 melanoma cells, B16）迁移与克隆形成能力（P<0.05）。转录组测序结果显示，PM2.5处理显著改变巨噬细胞基因表达谱，其中白细胞介素-1α（interleukin-1α, IL-1α）作为关键上调的分泌因子，富集于免疫抑制相关信号通路。临床数据库分析进一步表明，IL-1α表达水平与LUAD免疫微环境中巨噬细胞及调节性T淋巴细胞（regulatory T cells, Treg）浸润程度呈正相关，且IL-1α高表达与LUAD患者较差的总生存期显著关联（HR=1.5, P=0.0053）。Western blot、RT-qPCR及免疫荧光实验证实，PM2.5暴露可显著上调TAMs中IL-1α的表达并促进其分泌。结论 PM2.5暴露通过诱导巨噬细胞获得免疫抑制表型并增强肿瘤细胞恶性行为，从而促进LUAD进展。机制上，IL-1α可能是PM2.5暴露环境下巨噬细胞分泌的关键促癌因子。本研究为PM2.5相关LUAD的发病机制提供了新见解，并提示IL-1α可能成为潜在治疗靶点。 】 【中文关键词：肺肿瘤；PM2.5；肿瘤相关巨噬细胞；IL-1α；肿瘤微环境】."

Binding Multilateral Framework for South Asian Air Pollution Control: An Urgent Call for SAARC-UN Cooperation.,"South Asia's worsening air pollution crisis represents one of the most urgent public health and environmental challenges of the 21st century. Nearly two billion people-over one-quarter of the global population-reside in this region, where air quality levels routinely exceed World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines by factors of 10 to 15. This has translated into an unprecedented health burden, with approximately two million premature deaths annually, widespread chronic respiratory and cardiovascular disease, and rising economic losses. According to recent World Bank estimates, welfare losses amount to over 5% of regional GDP, a figure far exceeding the projected costs of coordinated mitigation. Despite this, South Asia continues to lack a binding regional framework capable of addressing its shared airshed. Existing cooperative efforts-such as the Malé Declaration on Control and Prevention of Air Pollution (1998)-have provided a useful platform for dialog and pilot monitoring, but they remain voluntary, under-resourced, and insufficient to manage the transboundary nature of the crisis. National-level programs, including India's National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), Bangladesh's National Air Quality Management Plan (NAQMP), and Nepal's National Air Quality Management Action Plan (AQMAP), demonstrate domestic commitment but are constrained by fragmentation, limited financing, and lack of regional integration. This gap represents the central knowledge and governance challenge that prompted the present commentary. To address it, we propose a dual-track architecture designed to institutionalize binding regional cooperation. Track A would establish a United Nations-anchored South Asian Transboundary Air Pollution Protocol, under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP). This protocol would codify legally enforceable emission standards, compliance committees, financial mechanisms, and harmonized monitoring. Track B would establish a South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Prime Ministers' Council on Air Quality (SPMCAQ) to provide political leadership, align domestic implementation, and authorize rapid responses to cross-border haze events. Lessons from the Indian Ocean Experiment, the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution, and Europe's Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution demonstrate that legally binding agreements combined with high-level political ownership can achieve durable reductions in pollution despite geopolitical tensions. By situating South Asia within these global precedents, the proposed framework provides a pragmatic, enforceable, and politically resilient pathway to protect health, reduce economic losses, and deliver cleaner air for nearly one-quarter of humanity."
Heterogeneous impact of fine particulate matter constituents on pulmonary tuberculosis onset: a multicenter time series study in Beijing.,"Epidemiological studies have implicated exposure to PM₂.₅ in the development of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB); however, the key constituents driving this effect have not been clearly identified. A time-series analysis spanning 2019 to 2023 was performed across several centers in Beijing to assess the links between major PM All five examined components demonstrated significant relationships with an elevated risk of PTB. Associations were not statistically significant on the same day (lag 0) or the next day (lag 1) after exposure. A clear risk increase was detected starting at a 2-day lag, which was no longer observable by lag 3. Per interquartile range (IQR) rise in the 3-day moving average (lag 0-2) of black carbon and organic matter, the relative risks (RRs) for PTB were 1.11 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03, 1.19] and 1.11 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.21), correspondingly. Together, these two components were the dominant drivers of the overall PM₂.₅ effect, contributing 41% and 39% of the joint risk, respectively. The results yield novel evidence that exposure to certain PM"
Exposure to diesel particulates induces an immunosuppressive microenvironment that promotes the progression of lung cancer.,"A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms by which air pollutant exposure drives cancer progression remains incomplete. Particulate matter has been shown to induce genotoxicity and mutagenesis through oxidative stress both in vivo and in vitro. However, its impact on the pulmonary immune microenvironment and its role in modulating anti-tumour immune responses remains poorly characterized. Here, we report that chronic exposure to diesel exhaust particles (DEPs), a major component of PM2.5, induces an immunosuppressive lung microenvironment that promotes tumour progression in a KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma model (Kras"
New insights into lung cancer risks in middle-aged and older Chinese adults: A CHARLS prospective cohort study with multi-source external validation.,"Lung cancer represents a significant public health burden in China; however, prospective studies on nationally representative risk factors are limited. This study identifies novel risk factors for lung cancer in middle-aged and older Chinese adults using prospective cohort data, with validation through multi-source methods. The study analyzed 14,964 cancer-free participants from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS, 2011-2018). Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate demographic, lifestyle, comorbidity, and environmental factors. External validation included the NHANES cohort (n = 20,278), bibliometric analysis (21,820 papers), and single-center hospital data (200 cases/200 controls). Key risk factors identified include urban residence (HR = 2.71, p = 0.014), diabetes (HR = 2.84, 95 % CI: 1.06-7.63), smoking behavior (each year of delayed smoking cessation increases risk by 4.8 %, each additional cigarette daily raises risk by 4.0 %), and biomass cooking fuel (HR = 5.98, p = 0.083). External validation confirmed the smoking metrics; however, the diabetes-lung cancer association was absent in the NHANES cohort. PM2.5 was also validated as a significant risk factor. Urban residence, diabetes, and smoking behaviors (cessation age/daily quantity) are identified as novel lung cancer risk factors in Chinese adults. The study supports tailored interventions focusing on air quality, metabolic management, and personalized smoking cessation programs, with individualized smoking assessments rather than a simple ""smoker/non-smoker"" classification."
Distinct DNA methylation in mother-infant dyads exposed to PM2.5 in pregnancy.,"Air pollution exposure during pregnancy increases the risk of allergic and respiratory diseases, yet its epigenetic effects across the maternal-fetal interface remain poorly understood. We conducted a pilot study of 10 mother-infant dyads near Fresno, California, to investigate whether prenatal air pollution exposure is associated with differential DNA methylation (DNAm) in maternal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and infant cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs). Using a custom DNAm array targeting high-value allergy- and asthma-associated loci, we identified 24 CpG sites in maternal PBMCs and 18 in infant CBMCs associated with PM2.5 exposure. Only one CpG site was shared between PBMCs and CBMCs, suggesting largely distinct DNAm responses to PM2.5 in maternal and fetal circulations. Further research is needed to validate these associations and determine their functional implications for immune development and disease risk."
Clara cell secretory protein 16 protects against PM2.5-induced ferroptosis in mouse lung epithelial cells in a concentration-dependent manner.,"Background Clara cell secretory protein 16 (CC16) has been reported to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects. However, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the protective effect and mechanism of CC16 using an  TC-1 cells were exposed to PM2.5 to induce inflammatory injury and ferroptosis, followed by treatment with CC16 at different concentrations (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 µg/mL). TC-1 cells were divided into six groups: control, CC16, PM2.5, PM2.5 + CC16 (0.25 μg/mL), PM2.5 + CC16 (0.5 μg/mL), and PM2.5 + CC16 (1.0 μg/mL) groups. Cell viability was assessed using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Levels of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-5, IL-6, IL-13, IL-17A, and IL-1β) in the supernatant were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Protein expression levels of Nrf2, ACSL4, SLC7A11, and GPX4 were detected using western blotting. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected with a fluorescent probe, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was measured by JC-1 staining. Glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and Fe PM2.5 exposure significantly reduced cell viability, aggravated inflammation, induced ferroptosis, and disrupted the integrity of mouse pulmonary epithelial cells. CC16 treatment reversed these effects in a concentration-dependent manner. CC16 effectively mitigates PM2.5-induced cellular injury in mouse pulmonary epithelial cells through inhibition of ferroptosis, with its protective effect showing a clear concentration dependence. These findings suggest CC16 as a novel strategy for PM2.5-induced respiratory disease."
A spatial lag model analysis of lung cancer incidence and satellite-derived data on air pollution in Thailand from 2020 to 2023.,"This study aimed at investigating the association between satellite-based remotely sensed data on particulate matter with diameters less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) on the one hand, with the incidence of lung cancer in Thailand on the other. Regression analyses on a nationwide dataset comprising 604,460 confirmed cases reported between 2020 and 2023 were conducted using the Spatial Lag Model (SLM) to assess the relationship between the ambient air pollutants and lung cancer incidence. The results revealed that provinces with the highest cancer incidence rates were consistently found to be located in the eastern part of north-eastern Thailand and the far North as well as some provinces in the South. The SLM accounted for a moderate proportion of variance in lung cancer incidence, with R² values ranging from 0.1548 to 0.1755 over the study period. PM2.5 concentrations were positively and significantly associated with incidence rates each year, an effect increasing from 2020 (0.2160, p=0.0075) to 2023 (0.3096, p=0.0102). These findings highlight the potential of satellite-based air quality data, particularly PM2.5 for predicting and monitoring lung cancer incidence, thereby supporting evidence- based public health planning and environmental policy in Thailand. The results add empirical evidence to the growing body of literature demonstrating the public health consequences of ambient air pollution."
Effect of particulate matter (PM,"Air pollution, especially particulate matter (PM This time trend longitudinal study was conducted in the Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from July 2024 to December 2024. This study investigated the death and disability-adjusted life years (DALYS) rates of respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and total cancers caused by air pollution in the GCC region: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The data were collected from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) based on the Global Burden of Disease 2021 dataset from 1990 to 2021. In GCC states, the highest rate of PM exposure in 2021 was in Qatar (56.95 per 100 people), whereas the lowest was in Oman (38.86 per 100 people). Qatar consistently achieved the highest decreases in death and DALY rates from 1990 to 2021. Among all the diseases, diabetes mellitus was the only one that presented an increase in deaths and DALYS in the GCC region from 1990 to 2021. The rising trend in air pollutant exposure is attributable to death and DALY rates in GCC countries. GCC states are at risk due to air pollution and associated with high mortality and DALY rates for different diseases."
Air pollution exposure and the burden of pediatric upper respiratory tract infections in emergency departments: a retrospective time-series study.,"Upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) are a major public health problem and a leading cause of pediatric Emergency Department (ED) visits. Approximately 81% of emergency outpatient visits in children are due to URTI, and respiratory diseases account for 12% of all deaths worldwide. Air pollution is considered an important factor contributing to the increased incidence of respiratory infections. The aim of this study was to examine the association between ambient air pollutant concentrations and the number of pediatric ED admissions for URTI. We conducted a retrospective analysis including 2,572 children admitted to the ED between 2015 and 2020 with a diagnosis of URTI. Daily concentrations of particulate matter (PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO"
Air pollution and lung cancer: a comprehensive review.,"Since 2013, air pollution has been recognised as a definite carcinogen by the IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer). This follows major international epidemiological studies, which now show that people living in a polluted environment are more likely to die of lung cancer. Worldwide, air pollution is the second leading cause of premature death and is estimated to be responsible for around 14 % of lung cancers. Fine particles (PM2.5) are particularly studied for their carcinogenic potential, and recent discoveries have given us a better understanding of their pathophysiological link with certain types of cancer, particularly those harboring mutations in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). The lung-cancer research community and clinical scientists should work to reduce sources of atmospheric pollution in the interests of public health, which must be accompanied by an effective fight against climate change, main announced cause of a deterioration in the quality of our common air."
Black ginseng extract alleviates particulate matter-induced airway inflammation by suppressing the ROS/NLRP3/caspase-1 pathway in macrophages.,"Black ginseng extract (BGE) is a processed form of ginseng used in East Asian medicine to treat inflammatory respiratory diseases and is known for its excellent bioavailability and pharmacological efficacy. This study investigates the preventative effects and mechanisms of BGE against inflammatory lung damage caused by particulate matter (PM) in mouse alveolar macrophages (MH-S) and a mouse lung injury model. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and MH-S cell viability were assessed using DCFDA and the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, respectively. In Balb/c mice exposed to a combination of PM10 and diesel exhaust particles (PM/DEP), various cell types involved in immune cell infiltration were examined through Diff-Quik staining and flow cytometry. Lung histological changes were analyzed using hematoxylin and eosin, Masson's trichrome, and immunofluorescence staining. The molecular mechanism of BGE was investigated via Western blotting, caspase-1 activity assay, secretory/cleaved IL-1β ELISA, and real-time qPCR. In PM2.5-stimulated MH-S cells, BGE inhibits inflammation and cellular damage by decreasing ROS levels involved in the NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis. In mice exposed to a PM/DEP, BGE reduces immune cell influx (mainly neutrophils), inflammatory cytokine expression, and abnormal histopathological changes. Notably, BGE administration decreases macrophage activation markers, such as F4/80 and IL-1α, in PM/DEP-exposed lungs. BGE also suppresses the activity of the NLRP3/caspase-1 pathway in mice's lungs. BGE prevents inflammatory lung injury by decreasing ROS levels, thereby inactivating the NLRP3/caspase-1/pyroptosis pathway both in vitro and in vivo. This study highlights BGE's potential as a natural treatment for PM-induced lung inflammation."
Chemical injury history increases pulmonary susceptibility to PM2.5 inhalation: Toxicological evidence for risk assessment in a neglected vulnerable population.,"Environmental health risk assessments typically prioritize vulnerable populations such as the elderly, children, and individuals with respiratory diseases. However, individuals with a history of chemical-induced lung injury are rarely considered, despite potentially heightened sensitivity to air pollutants. Therefore, this study investigated the pulmonary health risks of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 exposure in a chemical lung injury model, reflecting realistic exposure conditions. Mice were intratracheally administered polyhexamethylene guanidine phosphate (PHMG-P; 0.3 mg/kg), followed by nose-only exposure to PM2.5 (8.88 ± 1.77 mg/m"

Gradual Increase in Lung Cancer Risk Due to Particulate Matter Exposure in Patients With Pulmonary Function Impairments: A Nationwide Korean Database Analysis.,"Lung cancer remains a significant public health concern, with external environmental factors, such as particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), playing a crucial role in its development. This study aimed to assess the interaction between cumulative exposure to PM2.5 and lung function impairment, focusing on the risk of lung cancer in a large Korean population. Data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2007 to 2020 were analyzed with linkage of the national cancer registry. A total of 43,973 participants, including 386 lung cancer cases, were included, with spirometry data available to classify lung function into categories. PM2.5 exposure was quantified using geocoded address information. Logistic regression models with interaction terms were used to evaluate lung cancer risk according to PM2.5 exposure levels and in interaction of lung function categories. A significant increase in lung cancer risk was observed with higher PM2.5 exposure levels, with odds ratios (ORs) of 1.41, 1.59, and 1.68 for the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quartiles, respectively in multivariable models. Stratified analysis showed that the interaction between PM2.5 exposure and obstructive lung function significantly increased lung cancer risk, with ORs of 2.74 for spirometric obstruction and 3.43 for preserved ratio impaired spirometry in the highest PM2.5 quartile. This study suggests the carcinogenic risk of PM2.5 exposure, particularly in individuals with obstructive lung function impairments."
MUC1 alleviates PM2.5-induced airway inflammation by inhibiting the IRAK4/NF-κB/NLRP3 mediated pyroptosis in airway epithelial cells.,"Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) triggers airway inflammation through the activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway, contributing to the pathogenesis of various acute and chronic respiratory diseases. Mucin 1 (MUC1), a transmembrane glycoprotein highly expressed on airway epithelial cells, is known to modulate TLR-mediated inflammatory responses. However, the specific role and molecular mechanism by which MUC1 regulates PM2.5-induced airway inflammation remain inadequately understood. Lung injury models were established using Muc1 PM2.5 exposure caused notable epithelial disruption, inflammatory infiltration, and submucosal fibrosis in Muc1 MUC1 is upregulated in airway epithelial cells upon PM2.5 exposure and serves as a key endogenous inhibitor of airway inflammation. It exerts its anti-inflammatory and anti-pyroptotic effects by suppressing IRAK4 phosphorylation, thereby modulating downstream NF-κB/NLRP3/GSDMD signaling. These findings highlight MUC1 as a potential therapeutic target for PM2.5-induced airway inflammatory diseases."
Dynamic associations between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and respiratory-cardiovascular diseases: A trajectory analysis of a prospective study.,"Exposure to ambient air pollution constitutes a significant risk factor for both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, its impact on the progression of respiratory-cardiovascular disease trajectories, particularly among individuals with COPD, remains unclear. This study aims to assess the associations of long-term air pollution exposure with the progression from a healthy state to the development of COPD, subsequent CVD, and mortality, utilizing a multi-state modeling framework. We included 318,282 participants from the UK Biobank who were free of COPD and CVD at baseline in this prospective cohort study. Annual average concentrations of particulate matter (PM₂.₅, PM₁₀) and nitrogen oxides (NO₂, NOₓ), derived from participant residential histories and data from the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), were used to estimate long-term exposure. Multi-state models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for each 1 µg/m³ increase in air pollutant concentration in relation to disease transitions along the respiratory-cardiovascular trajectory. During a median follow-up period of 13.5 years, 6901 participants developed COPD; 2207 of whom subsequently developed CVD, and 15,921 participants died. All pollutants were significantly associated with adverse transitions in the respiratory-cardiovascular disease trajectory, Adjusted HRs (95 % CIs) per 1 µg/m³ increase in pollutant exposure for the transition from COPD to CVD were: NO Chronic exposure to ambient air pollution, particularly PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀, is linked to an elevated risk of progression from COPD to CVD, thereby augmenting the overall burden of respiratory-cardiovascular diseases. These findings highlight the urgent need for effective air quality interventions to reduce pollution-related health impacts."

Exposure to Household Air Pollution From Biomass Cooking and Severe Pneumonia in Infants.,"Household air pollution from biomass cooking is considered an important risk factor for child pneumonia. To evaluate the longitudinal association between exposure to particulate matter with a diameter of less than or equal to 2.5 µm (PM2.5) or carbon monoxide (CO) and severe pneumonia in infants. This cohort study included infants (aged ≤12 months) whose mothers participated in a 4-country randomized clinical trial. Conducted from May 2018 to September 2021, the trial tested whether an 18-month liquefied petroleum gas stove and fuel distribution intervention reduced the incidence of severe pneumonia in offspring during infancy when compared with biomass cooking. The trial was conducted in communities where residents cooked primarily with biomass fuels in Guatemala, India, Peru, and Rwanda. Data analysis was conducted from December 2024 to July 2025. Twenty-four hour personal exposure to PM2.5 and CO was measured 3 times during pregnancy and 3 times during infancy. In this exposure-response analysis, severe pneumonia cases were identified using respiratory signs and symptoms with confirmation of consolidation by imaging and hypoxemia by pulse oximetry. The longitudinal association between severe pneumonia in infants and PM2.5 or CO exposures by infant-quarters, adjusted for confounders, was modeled. Overall, 3061 infants (48.2% girls; mean [SD] gestational age at birth, 39.3 [1.7] weeks) contributed 11 996 infant-quarters and 13 910 measurements of personal PM2.5 exposures (range, 5.4-1182.0 µg/m3). A total of 175 episodes of severe pneumonia were identified in 160 infants. Those with at least 1 episode of severe pneumonia had similar mean (SD) prenatal (101 [100] µg/m3 vs 88 [80] µg/m3; P = .11) and postnatal (70 [78] µg/m3 vs 67 [93] µg/m3; P = .68) PM2.5 exposures when compared with infants without severe pneumonia. There were no associations between prenatal (adjusted risk ratio [RR], 1.03; 95% CI, 0.94-1.13) or postnatal (adjusted RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87-1.09) PM2.5 exposures and severe pneumonia or between CO exposures and severe pneumonia. In this cohort study with exposure-response analysis, there was no evidence of an association between longitudinal PM2.5 or CO exposures and severe pneumonia in infants. Taken with the intention-to-treat analysis from the randomized clinical trial, these results challenge prior research suggesting that PM2.5 or CO exposures from biomass cooking are an important risk factor for severe pneumonia in infants."
Air Quality Index as a Predictor of Respiratory Morbidity in At-Risk Populations.,"The Mon Valley near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, consistently reports some of the poorest air quality in the United States. Recent studies have linked air pollution in this region to poor asthma outcomes but did not examine the impact on other respiratory conditions or vulnerable populations. This retrospective study examined the relationship between the air quality index (AQI) and respiratory exacerbations of asthma, bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the Mon Valley between January 2018 and February 2020. We linked daily Air Quality Index (AQI) values for ozone, PM"

Pseudohypoxia induced by chemical pollutants: Biochemical evidence of environmental vulnerability.,"Chemical pollutants can abnormally elevate hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) levels under normoxic conditions, leading to pseudohypoxia. This condition disrupts normal cellular energy metabolism, gene expression, and signal transduction, thereby inducing detrimental physiological effects. Pseudohypoxia can also increase the risk of various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic respiratory diseases, while adversely affecting disease treatment and prognosis. Focusing on the intersection between environmental pollution and hypoxia signaling pathways, this review proposes a novel concept that chemical pollutants can induce pseudohypoxia and elucidates its underlying mechanisms. We also identify various environmental pollutants that induce pseudohypoxia, including but not limited to metals and metalloids (e.g., cadmium, cobalt, arsenic), persistent organic pollutants (e.g., BPA, dioxins, PCBs), and atmospheric particulate pollutants (e.g., PM2.5, diesel exhaust particles), and examine the complex interplay between these pollutants, pseudohypoxia, and various diseases. This review aims to offer novel strategies for managing pseudohypoxia caused by environmental exposures, thereby offering new insights into the prevention and treatment of environmental exposure-related disease and susceptibility."
"Association between outdoor air pollution and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Xinjiang, China.","This study investigated the association between short-term exposure to air pollutants and hospital admissions for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) in Northwest China. We analyzed data from a tertiary hospital in Xinjiang (2014-2023), along with air pollutant and meteorological data. Using a time-series approach with generalized additive models and distributed lag nonlinear models, we found that interquartile range increases in PM₂.₅, PM₁₀, NO₂, CO, and O₃ were associated with increased AECOPD admissions of 4.70% (95% CI: 1.48%, 8.01%), 1.61% (0.38%, 2.86%), 15.97% (7.36%, 25.28%), 35.64% (15.84%, 58.82%), and 5.89% (1.10%, 10.90%), respectively, with peak effects at lag 0. Stratified analyses identified sex-, age-, and season-specific relationships, including protective effects of O₃ and CO in males at longer lags, heightened susceptibility to particulate matter and NO₂ in adults aged ≥65 years, and distinct seasonal patterns for NO₂, O₃, and CO. These findings demonstrate that short-term air pollution exposure is significantly associated with AECOPD hospitalizations in this understudied region."
Greater lung cancer polygenic risk score in higher air pollution areas linked to greater rate of lung adenocarcinoma: a single-centre study in East Asia.,"Lung cancer, a leading cause of cancer deaths, is influenced by smoking, air pollution and genetic factors. This study investigated the association between lung cancer polygenic risk score (PRS) and air pollution in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cases in East Asia. This Taiwanese case-control study included 57 257 participants, of whom 1059 were diagnosed with lung cancer and 857 had LUAD. Excluding individuals with missing PRS data, the final study group comprised 648 LUAD patients and 6480 age- and gender-matched controls. Logistic regression models were employed to assess the association between PRS and LUAD risk, and interaction effects between PRS and particulate matter (PM2.5/PM10) exposure were evaluated. PGS000070 demonstrated an OR of 2.796 (95% CI 2.236 to 3.497, p<0.001), while PGS000392 exhibited an OR of 1.938 (95% CI 1.559 to 2.409, p<0.001). Higher PM exposure increased LUAD risk among individuals in the highest quartile (Q4) of both PRSs compared with the lowest quartile (Q1). In the smoking subgroup, individuals in Q4 for PGS000070 showed significantly heightened LUAD risk when exposed to higher PM2.5 and PM10 levels, with ORs of 4.08 (p<0.0001) and 2.897 (p<0.0001), respectively. However, the interaction effect of PRS (PGS000070 and PGS000392) and PM exposure on LUAD risk was not statistically significant. This hospital-based study indicated that LUAD patients had higher PRSs and greater exposure to PM. However, the interaction effect between PRS (PGS000070 and PGS000392) and PM exposure on LUAD risk was not statistically significant, suggesting these factors act independently. The accumulation of air pollution did not show a gradual increase in LUAD risk. Notably, the association between PRS and air pollution was more pronounced in the smoking subgroup for PGS000070 but not for PGS000392."
Modifying effects of PM,"Extreme heat is a critical public health threat, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. While its direct health impacts are well documented, less is known about how air pollution modifies heat-related risks. We analyzed daily hospital admissions for circulatory and respiratory diseases in Brazil (2008-2018), combined with high-resolution temperature and pollution (PM₂.₅ and O₃) data. Using generalized additive models and random-effects meta-analysis, we found that PM₂.₅ consistently amplified the effect of heat on respiratory admissions, with a 20.1% increase in risk under high PM₂.₅ conditions (95% CI 4.8-35.4%). In contrast, O₃ showed heterogeneous effects, including a national-level protective association at high concentrations (- 7.6%, 95% CI - 9.6 to - 5.6%). Regional analyses revealed stronger interactions in the North and Southeast. These findings indicate that PM₂.₅ exacerbates, and O₃ variably modifies, heat-related hospitalizations in Brazil, underscoring the need for regionally tailored adaptation and air quality policies."
The Joint Effects of Extreme Heat and Wildfire Smoke on Paediatric Acute Care Utilisation.,"As climate change worsens, instances of combined extreme heat and wildfire smoke events are becoming more frequent. Despite their increased vulnerability, investigations on the joint effect of wildfire smoke and extreme heat on children's health are limited. To investigate the joint effects of extreme heat and wildfire smoke on paediatric acute care utilisation (ACU) in California from 2006 to 2019. In this case-crossover analysis, we assembled a time-series dataset of warm seasons, (May-September) for 1772 ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) in California from 2006 to 2019 to evaluate daily ACUs in the paediatric population (0-19 years). For wildfire smoke, we identified ZCTA-days exposed using a previously developed time-series dataset. For extreme heat, we calculated the daily ZCTA-specific maximum heat index. There were four exposure types: exposed to extreme heat alone, exposed to wildfire smoke alone, exposed to both events simultaneously (compound event) and not exposed to either event. We quantified the synergistic effects by comparing a child's exposures on the day when an ACU occurred to the child's exposure during control days. We found 1100-105,788 ZCTA-days where exposure to both extreme heat and wildfire smoke events occurred across eight combinations of event definitions. The relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) ranged up to 0.11 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.03, 0.19) with thresholds of the 95th percentile for extreme heat and 35 μg/m Investigating the synergistic effects of extreme heat and wildfire smoke events in paediatric populations is necessary to develop effective health protection strategies."
Trends in PM₂.₅ and mortality risks in an industrial District of Taiwan: a 12-year analysis.,"Ambient air pollution, particularly fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅), poses a major global public health concern. We examined trends in all-cause and respiratory disease-specific mortality and their association with PM₂.₅ concentrations during three time periods (2008-2011, 2012-2015, 2016-2019) in Linyuan District, Kaohsiung City, and Taiwan, using generalized Poisson mixed models. PM₂.₅ concentrations declined by 23.6% in Taiwan, from 24.5 µg/m"
Effects of PM2.5 Reduction Interventions on Cardiovascular Indicators: A Meta-analysis.,"Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, but the effectiveness of individual-level interventions to reduce exposure remains unclear. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the effects of four distinct categories of PM2.5 interventions on cardiovascular health including high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, respiratory protective equipment, improved cookstoves, and other behavioral PM2.5 reduction methods. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane library for studies published between December 2002 and March 2025 that reported the cardiovascular effect of PM2.5 reduction. Intervention methods were categorized based on their mechanisms of action and implementation settings. The primary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), with secondary outcomes including endothelial function indices, heart rate variability (HRV), and inflammatory markers. A total of 72 trials involving 6,063 participants (age range: 12.4-82 years) were included. Overall, PM2.5 reduction interventions significantly decreased SBP by 1.97 mmHg (95% CI: -2.89, -1.05) and DBP by 1.08 mmHg (95% CI: -1.80, -0.35). Among secondary outcomes, C-reactive protein (CRP) decreased significantly (MD = -0.03mg/dl, 95% CI: -0.06, -0.00, P = 0.042), while no significant changes were observed in interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), or HRV. Subgroup analyses revealed differential effects by intervention type: Air filtration interventions showed the largest effect on SBP (MD = -1.94mmHg, 95% CI: -3.33, -0.55, P = 0.006) compared to other interventions. These findings suggest that PM2.5 reduction interventions could lower blood pressure and reduce markers of systemic inflammation, indicating that personal-level interventions may provide measurable cardiovascular benefits, even with short-term implementation."
Seasonal and COVID-19 lockdown variations in PM,"To investigate seasonal and COVID-19-lockdown variations in PM2.5 chemical composition in Taipei and the effects of those compositional differences on lung cell toxicity. PM2.5 was collected in warm (2021/07-2021/08) and cold (2021/11-2022/02) seasons and during LV2/LV3 COVID-19 alert periods. Composition (metals, PAHs) was analyzed and A549 and PC9 lung cells were exposed to equal mass concentrations (0-100 μg/mL) of extracted PM2.5. Cell viability, ROS, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential and GSH/GPX4 were measured. At equivalent mass concentrations (50 μg/mL), warm-season PM2.5 induced higher ROS and greater reduction in viability than cold-season PM2.5. LV2-period PM2.5 contained higher metal content and caused more severe cellular damage than LV3. Spearman correlation plus single-compound assays identified cadmium and Dibenzo[a,e]pyrene as components strongly associated with cytotoxicity. Seasonal and human-activity driven compositional changes-rather than mass concentration alone-affect PM2.5 toxicity in vitro; these results underscore the importance of controlling specific chemical emissions."
The burden and risk factors of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Asia and its countries from 1990 to 2021: a systematic analysis based on the 2021 global burden of disease study.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. In Asia, risk exposures such as smoking and ambient PM₂.₅ are prevalent, and regional differences are significant. This has led to the COPD disease burden in this region being at a relatively high level globally. Based on this, this study conducts a systematic assessment of the COPD disease burden in Asia. Data on incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study. The analysis incorporated the Sociodemographic Index (SDI) and included stratification by sex and age to reveal the distribution and disparities in the burden of COPD across populations. Joinpoint regression models were used to calculate the annual percent change (APC) and average annual percent change (AAPC) to estimate temporal trends. In addition, major attributable risk factors for COPD were analyzed to identify key drivers of disease burden across regions and populations. In 2021, the number of COPD cases in Asia reached 10,512,843 (95% UI: 9,610,006-11,432,970), with an age-standardized incidence rate of 210.79 per 100,000 persons (95% UI: 193.52-227.94). COPD accounted for 2,885,059 deaths (95% UI: 2,571,267-3,218,689), corresponding to an age-standardized mortality rate of 64.10 per 100,000 persons (95% UI: 56.74-71.66). The total DALYs were 60,507,100 (95% UI: 55,319,463-66,518,282), with an age-standardized rate of 1,253.15 per 100,000 persons (95% UI: 1,148.26-1,376.29). Among Asian subregions, South Asia bore the heaviest burden of COPD. Major risk factors included particulate matter (PM) pollution, smoking, secondhand smoke, and occupational exposure to particulate matter, gases, and fumes (OP-MGF). This study highlights the substantial COPD burden in Asia, with air pollution, smoking, and occupational exposures being the predominant risk factors. Targeted public health interventions are urgently needed to mitigate the COPD burden and improve overall health outcomes in the region."
The impact of systemic inflammatory markers on EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer.,"High prevalence of EGFRm lung cancer was found in the Asian population. Preclinical data suggest that inflammatory cytokines activated by PM2.5 affected EGFRm clone expansion. Here, we explored the correlation between inflammatory markers and EGFRm NSCLC. Resected NSCLC patients (2016-2023) were enrolled. Tumor tissues and blood serum were retrieved from Ramathibodi tumor biobank. EGFR 19del and L858R mutations were performed by rt-PCR in cancerous tissue and dPCR in normal tissue in the same patient. NF-Kb and STAT3 protein signaling were measured by ELISA in both cancerous and normal tissue. Cytokines (IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 and TNF-α) were explored in serum by flow cytometry. Among 140 patients, EGFRm prevalence was 58% in cancerous tissue but only 5% in normal tissue. NF-kB and STAT3 were statistically higher in cancerous tissue than normal tissue [NF-kB median O.D.=0.82 (IQR; 0.07-2.82) vs. 0.32 (IQR; 0.05-2.48), P < 0.001; STAT3 median O.D.=0.32 (IQR; 0.10-1.58) vs. 0.17 (IQR; 0.06-1.29, P < 0.001]. STAT3 was significantly increased in EGFRm compared to EGFRwt [median O.D.=0.36 (IQR; 0.234-0.592) vs. 0.23 (IQR; 0.158-0.409), OR = 11.09 (95% CI; 2.17-56.58), P = 0.004]. TNF-α, IL-10, and STAT3 in cancer cells were higher in EGFRm than EGFRwt (P = 0.003, 0.008, and < 0.001, respectively). None of cytokines was statistically different between EGFRm and EGFRwt patients. However, only STAT3 in cancer cells and non-smoker were associated with EGFRm NSCLC in multivariable analysis. Inflammation could be one of the pathogenesis of both NSCLC and EGFRm lung cancer as we demonstrated in our pilot study. STAT3 is a potentially inflammatory-predictive biomarkers. Larger cohort is needed."
Impact of long-term exposure to PM,Epidemiological evidence indicates a close association between particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of fewer than 2.5 μm (PM This study used data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) from 2011 to 2018 to explore the relationship between long-term exposure to PM Results reveal a significant positive correlation between long-term exposure to PM This prospective cohort study of middle-aged and older adults in China observed that long-term exposure to various PM
Exposure to living environmental risk factors and incidence of chronic lung disease in Chinese adults: results from a cross-sectional and longitudinal study.,"Chronic lung disease (CLD) imposes substantial health burdens on Chinese adults. While prior studies have focused on isolated environmental factors, this study comprehensively evaluated the synergistic effects of living environmental risk factors (LEFs), including indoor fuel type, water source, exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), housing conditions, and indoor temperature/humidity, on CLD development. Utilizing data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS, 2011-2018), cross-sectional (n = 12,318) and longitudinal (n = 8,516) analyses were conducted. LEFs score were derived from multi-domain environmental metrics. Logistic regression was used to identify baseline associations between LEFs and CLD, while Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate longitudinal risks. Adjusted covariates included sociodemographic, lifestyle, comorbidities, and regional factors. Poor quality of the living environment was significantly correlated with CLD prevalence (cross-sectional OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.03-1.27) and incidence (longitudinal HR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.10-1.42) after full adjustment. Key risk factors included indoor solid fuel use, unsuitable indoor temperature, and excessive humidity. Subgroup analyses highlighted stronger associations among rural residents and individuals with comorbidities. Integrated assessment of environmental risks is critical for CLD prevention. Mitigating indoor air pollution, optimizing thermal conditions, and improving housing quality may reduce disease burden. Public health policies should prioritize multifaceted environmental interventions for high-risk populations."
Progressive lung fibrosis in aged mice induced by repetitive bleomycin: Exacerbation by long-term PM₂.₅ inhalation.,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal interstitial lung disease marked by spatially and temporally heterogeneous fibrotic remodeling. Although epidemiological studies suggest that prolonged exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) accelerates IPF progression, the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect remain poorly defined. The objective of this study was to establish an experimental model that better reflects the chronicity and pathological complexity of IPF. To this end, we developed a repetitive low-dose bleomycin (BLM) model in aged mice and subjected them to long-term PM2.5 inhalation. This approach induced sustained fibrosis with histological features resembling usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), including alveolar epithelial hyperplasia, bronchiolar metaplasia, cystic remodeling, and fibroblastic foci. Transcriptomic profiling revealed extensive gene expression reprogramming, with a greater overlap with human IPF signatures than observed in the single-dose model. Notably, 27.5 % of differentially expressed genes were shared with human IPF lungs, particularly those involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, epithelial repair, and immune modulation. PM2.5 exposure further exacerbated fibrotic remodeling, reduced survival, and increased fibrotic marker expression. Additional transcriptomic analysis identified PM2.5-specific gene signatures enriched in mitotic dysregulation, chromatin remodeling, and epithelial stress responses, with key hub genes such as BNIP3, SERPINE1, and BIRC5. In conclusion, our repetitive BLM model in aged mice effectively recapitulates the histopathological and molecular landscape of IPF and provides a physiologically relevant platform for studying chronic fibrogenesis. This model also enables mechanistic investigation of environmental exacerbators such as PM2.5, offering new insights into gene-environment interactions that drive pollutant-induced fibrotic progression."
Association of lung silica deposition with epidermal growth factor receptor-mutant lung cancer.,"Exposure to particulate matter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5), which comprises various components, has been implicated in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-driven lung cancer development. The silica can be inhaled non-occupationally as PM2.5, particularly that derived from Asian dust in East Asia. This retrospective cross-sectional study investigated consecutive patients with surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma tested for EGFR mutations during 2020-2022. Silica particles in the resected lungs were counted via polarized light microscopy. Patients were categorized into high- and low-silica groups according to the cutoff value of the number of silica deposits. We conducted receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for EGFR mutation status according to silica deposit levels. We compared EGFR mutation profiles and performed logistic regression model analysis. Of the 174 patients, only three had an occupational silica-exposure history. The median numbers of silica deposits in 20 microscopic fields-of-view were 26.0 and 9.0 particles in patients with and without EGFR mutations, respectively (P < 0.001). EGFR mutations occurred in 66.7 % and 30.4 % of participants in the high- (n = 72) and low-silica groups (n = 102), respectively (P < 0.001). The Cochran-Armitage trend test showed a significant linear trend for higher silica deposition with a higher prevalence of EGFR mutations (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that high silica deposition was independently associated with EGFR mutations (adjusted odds ratio, 3.20; 95 % confidence interval, 1.49-6.88; P = 0.003). Silica can be deposited in the lungs even without occupational exposure and is associated with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma."
Epidemiological and Clinical Evidence on the Association Between Wildfire PM2.5 and Pulmonary Health Outcomes.,"As climate change accelerates the frequency and severity of wildfires worldwide, the pulmonary consequences of wildfire smoke exposure have emerged as an important yet under-recognized public health concern. Wildfire-related fine particulate matter (PM2.5) possesses distinct toxicologic properties compared to urban PM2.5 and disproportionately affects vulnerable populations, including children, older adults, and individuals with chronic respiratory diseases. This narrative review synthesizes current epidemiological, mechanistic, and clinical evidence on the impact of wildfire PM2.5 on exacerbations and progression of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and interstitial lung disease (ILD), drawing from recent large-scale meta-analyses and international cohort studies. We reviewed data from over 30 peer-reviewed sources, including longitudinal cohorts, systematic reviews, environmental modeling studies, and public health guidelines. Special attention was given to pediatric populations, the elderly, and patients with pre-existing pulmonary conditions. Wildfire PM2.5 is consistently associated with significant increases in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for asthma and COPD, with relative risks often exceeding those of urban PM2.5. Pediatric asthma-related visits may increase by over 30% during wildfire events, while elderly COPD patients face heightened hospitalization and mortality risks. ILD patients, especially those with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), exhibit higher rates of acute exacerbations and accelerated disease progression with PM2.5 levels as low as 8-10 μg/m³. Mechanistically, wildfire PM2.5 promotes oxidative stress, epithelial injury, and immune dysregulation, contributing to disease exacerbation and chronic progression. Preventive interventions such as high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration, indoor sheltering, and respiratory protection significantly reduce PM2.5 exposure and related morbidity. Wildfire PM2.5 is a potent and growing contributor to pulmonary morbidity, with a higher toxicity profile than other ambient air pollutants. While acute impacts are well-documented, long-term consequences remain understudied. Urgent research is needed to define chronic health outcomes, develop interventions, and inform public health policy. As wildfires become more frequent and intense globally, clinicians must be prepared to recognize and manage the growing burden of wildfire-related pulmonary disease."
DALYs-Based Health Risk Assessment and Key Influencing Factors of PM,The health risks of PM
Dynamic airborne mycobiome in the metropolitan city transit system is driven by seasonality and station type.,"Subway transit systems serve as the primary transportation mode in metropolitan areas. The quality of the airway in transit plays a crucial role in human health as commuters and workers are exposed to microbes transmitted from passengers and circulated within built environments. The diversity and dynamics of bacterial microbiome in these environments have been relatively well studied. However, the fungal communities remain poorly investigated. In this study, we conducted a year-long comprehensive investigation of the mycobiomes within the world's second largest subway system and analyzed the seasonal dynamics of fungal composition across intercity hub stations, urban hub stations, and suburban stations. We found a high diversity of the subway mycobiome that varied seasonally and was influenced by various environmental factors, such as particulate matter (PM2.5) levels and average humidity. Fungal diversity was higher in months with elevated PM2.5 pollution. Autumn exhibited increased diversity and peaks in the distribution of human pathogenic fungi. Furthermore, it was determined that station types exert a significant influence on the diversity of pathogenic fungi, with interchange stations (train and airport transfer stations) showing the highest diversity, while suburban stations showed the lowest. The core taxa of the mycobiome comprised several genera including ubiquitous fungi commonly found in soil and outdoor environments (e.g.,  Respiratory infections and allergic reactions caused by airborne fungi have received considerable public attention; however, fungal communities remain poorly investigated. This research performed the first year-long investigation of airborne mycobiome in the world's largest subway system. We found that the fungal diversity peaks in autumn and at stations with higher PM2.5 levels. Intercity hubs exhibit the highest diversity of pathogenic fungi and the least seasonal fluctuation. Suburban stations revealed a reduced diversity of human pathogens but an elevated presence of plant pathogens. Core fungal taxa in subways include both common soil fungi (e.g., "
"PM2.5-Related Burden of Tracheal, Bronchial, and Lung Cancer in China, the United States, Japan, and South Korea (1990-2021).","To quantify the tracheal, bronchial, and lung cancer burden attributable to particulate matter pollution in selected countries, and thereby provide evidence for context - specific public health interventions. Based on Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 data,we appliedJoinPoint to analyze the temporal trends from 1990-2021 in the burden of PM2.5 - attributable tracheal, bronchial, and lung (TBL) cancer in China, the US, Japan, and South Korea. And we explored the age, period, cohort effects and predicted future trends using the age-period-cohort mode and Bayesian analysis. Globally, the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) for TBL cancers due to PM2.5 exposure showed a declining trend with an average annual percentage change (AAPC) of-1.2811 from1990 to 2021, projections suggest continued decreases in ASMR in selected countries over the next 29 years, but a global increase is expected. Studies have demonstrated a global decline in the mortality burden attributed to bronchogenic carcinoma linked to PM2.5. Nevertheless, future projections indicate that the global burden of air pollution-related TBL cancer will rise, effective public health strategies are urgent to develop."
"Impact of short-term exposure to ambient air pollution on cardiovascular disease outpatient visits: a time-series study in Yichang, China.","Rapid industrialization has exacerbated ambient air pollution in Yichang, China, posing cardiovascular health risks. This study evaluates the short-term impact of ambient air pollutants on cardiovascular disease (CVD) outpatient visits and assesses the effectiveness of environmental policies implemented post-2018. We analyzed 510,831 CVD outpatient records alongside daily concentrations of PM Short-term exposure to NO₂ (lag05, RR = 1.253, 95% CI: 1.192-1.317), SO₂ (lag0, RR = 1.053, 95% CI: 1.011-1.096), and CO (lag01, RR = 1.063, 95% CI: 1.016-1.111) was significantly associated with increased cardiovascular disease outpatient visits. Concentrations of five major ambient air pollutants (excluding O₃) showed significant reductions after 2018 (P < 0.001). The associations of SO₂, CO, and PM₁₀ with CVD visits were attenuated after 2018. NO₂ effects were stronger in colder seasons and remained robust in two-pollutant models. No statistically significant associations were observed for PM₂.₅, PM₁₀, and O₃. Short-term exposure to NO₂, SO₂, and CO demonstrated statistically significant positive associations with cardiovascular disease outpatient visits. Environmental policies reduced ambient air pollutant levels and attenuated health impacts, supporting continued air quality interventions."
Toward the application of metallothionein inducers as a method of prevention of air pollutant-dependent lung injury.,"Although Sustainable Development Goal 3.9 states the global goal of reducing air pollution-related death and disease, innovative ways to reduce air pollution-related deaths and diseases have not yet been established.

"Effects of Daikin air purifiers on asthma control and pulmonary function: A multicenter, single-arm, observational pilot study.","While numerous studies, including systematic reviews, have investigated the effects of air purifiers on asthma control in Western countries, there is a paucity of research conducted in Japan. This multicenter, single-arm, observational pilot study examined the effect of air purifiers on asthma control in Japanese patients. This study was conducted at the Kyoto University Hospital and the Ayabe City Hospital. The air purifiers (MCK704ABK: Daikin Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) were equipped with electrostatic high-efficiency particulate air filters, capable of capturing 99.97 % of particles ≥0.3 μm. We examined changes in particulate matter (PM) 2.5 levels and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV Eighteen patients (median age: 64 [58, 70] years, 66.7 % female) participated in the study. The median PM2.5 concentration significantly decreased from 4.6 (3.4, 6.9) μg/m The Daikin air purifiers demonstrated the potential to reduce PM levels and improve pulmonary function and asthma symptoms."

Particulate matter and exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: analysis of emergency department visits in a low-pollution area.,"To evaluate the association between particulate matter concentration (PM10 and PM2.5) and the number of emergency department visits for exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in a low-pollution area. We conducted an ecological study based on emergency department visits for COPD exacerbations. A generalized additive model was used to estimate the relative risk and attributable fraction (AF), adjusting for weather variables. Pollution levels on the day of the visit and the 5 preceding days were considered to assess potential delayed effects of exposure. A total of 2,045 patients with 5,233 emergency department visits were included. A total of 79.1% of the patients were men. The mean age was 79.5 years (SD, 10.1). The mean concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 was 11.5 µg/m³ and 17.3 µg/m³, respectively. Both emergency visits and particulate matter concentrations showed a seasonalpattern. A significant association was found with exposure occurring 3 days prior (lag -3), with a 5.8% increase in visits for every 10 µg/m³ increase in PM2.5 (AF 5.45%) and a 3.3% increase for PM10 (AF 3.15%). Men and patients older than 75 years showed greater sensitivity to exposure. The impact of particulate matter was more pronounced during the summer months. Exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 is associated with an increase in emergency department visits for COPD exacerbations, with a particular impact among men, patients older than 75 years, and during the summer season.

Estudio ecológico basado en las consultas a urgencias por exacerbación de EPOC. Se empleó un modelo aditivo generalizado para estimar el riesgo relativo y la fracción atribuible (FA), y se ajustó por variables climatológicas. Se consideraron los niveles de contaminación del día de la visita y de los 5 días previos para evaluar posibles efectos retardados de la exposición. Se incluyeron 2.045 pacientes con 5.233 visitas a urgencias. El 79,1% de los pacientes eran varones. La edad media fue de 79,5 años (DE 10,1). La concentración media de PM2,5 y PM10 fue de 11,5 μg/m3 y 17,3 μg/m3 respectivamente. Tanto las visitas a urgencias como la concentración de material particulado mostraron un patrón estacional. Se encontró una asociación significativa con la exposición ocurrida en los 3 días previos (lag –3) con incremento del 5,8% en las consultas por cada aumento de 10 μg/m3 de PM2,5 (FA 5,45 %) y del 3,3 % para PM10 (FA 3,15%). Los hombres y pacientes mayores de 75 años presentaron una mayor sensibilidad a la exposición. El impacto del material particulado fue más intenso en los meses de verano. La exposición a PM2,5 y PM10 se asocia con un aumento de las consultas a urgencias por exacerbación de EPOC, con especial incidencia en varones, pacientes de más de 75 años y en la estación de verano."
Early life exposure to ambient particulate matter and Kawasaki disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Though numerous air pollutants have been mechanistically associated with inflammation and vascular morbidity, particulate matter (PM) is one of the pollutants with the strongest association. However, PM is generally categorized according to aerodynamic diameters between 2.5 and 10 μg m A systematic search was conducted using PubMed and EMBASE. Studies with PM included as a predictor, and Kawasaki disease as an outcome were included. This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The risk of bias in the selected studies was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Eleven studies met the criteria for inclusion. All studies suggested an association between exposure to PM and increase risk or exacerbation of KD, though not all results reached statistical significance. Due to significant heterogeneity, pooled analyses were possible only in select studies for pre- and postnatal PM Particulate matter exposure is associated with an increased risk of developing and exacerbating KD, especially in populations experiencing temporary increased sensitivity and in populations with preexisting inflammatory diseases. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42023468937, PROSPERO CRD42023468937."
Wildfire Exposure and Respiratory Health: A Comprehensive Review of Emerging Evidence.,"In January 2025, a catastrophic wildfire in Los Angeles, California, resulted in extensive economic losses and created a substantial risk to public respiratory health. With the progression of climate change, the increasing frequency and severity of wildfires have become a critical global issue due to their substantial impact on respiratory health. Wildfire smoke comprises elevated levels of ambient air pollutants, such as particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (O3), and a range of toxic substances. Notably, wildfire-related PM is especially detrimental because it can penetrate deeply into the lower respiratory tract and alveoli, provoking stronger oxidative and inflammatory responses, and leading to both the development and worsening of respiratory conditions, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Research indicates that short-term exposure to wildfire smoke is linked to acute exacerbations of asthma, COPD, and pneumonia, contributing to higher mortality rates and increased demands on healthcare utilization. Long-term exposure may increase the risk of developing COPD, accelerate disease progression, and is potentially linked to a heightened risk of lung cancer and mortality. Collectively, these data underscore the substantial threat posed by wildfire smoke, escalating morbidity, mortality, and socioeconomic burdens. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in our understanding of respiratory health impacts linked with wildfire smoke exposure. By aggregating current evidence, the review seeks to guide healthcare practitioners and public health officials, thereby promoting evidence-based interventions for clinical management, health communication, and disaster response amid the escalating risk associated with wildfires."
Immunosuppression induced by co-exposure to allergens and PM2.5 increases the risk of lung disease upon viral protein challenge.,"Particulate matter (PM2.5) and allergens are common environmental exposures. However, their combined effects and their risks are still poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the impact of co-exposure to house dust mites (HDM) allergens and diesel exhaust particles (DEP) on lung immune responses, and assess the susceptibility to viral protein. We found that compared with HDM alone, mice co-exposed to HDM and DEP showed DEP-phagocytosed macrophages in lungs and did not show asthma phenotypes, including T helper 2 (Th2) response, eosinophilic inflammation, mucus production, and serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) production. Mechanistically, DEP induced an immunosuppressive state by suppressing HDM-induced Th2 responses by reducing FcγRIIB and FcγRIII-mediated phagocytosis and antigen presentation in the lungs. Notably, short-term exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunit 1 (S1) in altered immune environment led to the development of pulmonary fibrosis. This was accompanied by elevated transforming growth factor-β"

"Impact of black carbon exposure on length of hospital stay in asthma patients: a retrospective cohort study in yulin, China.","BACKGROUND: While PM₂.₅ exposure is linked to asthma exacerbations, components-specific effects on healthcare burden remain understudied. Hospital length of stay (LOS), a critical indicator of disease severity and healthcare costs, has received limited attention in black carbon (BC) research. To quantify the association between short-term exposure to PM₂.₅ components-particularly black carbon (BC)-and LOS among asthma patients, and to identify vulnerable populations and critical exposure windows. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 4,509 asthma patients (ICD-10: J45 ~ J46) hospitalized in Yulin, China (2018 ~ 2023). Daily PM Each 1.00 µg/m³ increase in BC concentration at lag9 significantly associated with a 0.45-days prolongation in hospital stay (95%CI: 0.12 ~ 0.78). Age-stratified analysis revealed heightened vulnerability in children (effect observed at lag1 ~ 3, lag7 ~ 9) and middle-aged adults (sustained effects lag2 ~ 10), while elderly patients showed no significant associations. Seasonal analysis demonstrated that BC effects were more pronounced during non-pollen season (0.77 additional days per 1.00 µg/m³ increase), with no significant effects during pollen season. Restricted cubic spline analysis confirmed dose-response relationships, with effects plateauing at BC concentrations ≥ 1.98 µg/m³. Short-term BC exposure was significantly associated with extend asthma hospitalization duration, with critical exposure windows at lag9 and pronounced vulnerability in children and middle-aged adults during non-pollen seasons. These findings provide quantitative evidence supporting BC-specific emission controls in air quality policies and highlight the need for targeted protection of vulnerable populations, particularly in high-population regions."
Ecological assessment of extreme temperature and fine particulate matter (pm2.5) impact on diabetes service and outcomes in Thailand.,"Environmental changes, such as extreme heat and air pollution, are assumed to exacerbate chronic conditions like diabetes and increase demand for related health services. This study investigates how daily maximum temperature and air pollution affect diabetes service utilization in Thailand. Using ecological analysis, national diabetes service data from the Thai Ministry of Public Health and ERA5 LAND satellite data (from 2018 to 2023) were examined. The data included 2-meter ambient temperature and particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations, adjusted for health system variables, aggregated risk factors, the COVID-19 outbreak response, and spatiotemporal correlations. A generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) was employed to assess the effects of maximum temperature and PM2.5 on diabetes screening and the proportion of patients with controlled blood glucose. The analysis revealed an annual average maximum temperature of 38.6 °C and an average PM2.5 concentration of 21.6 µg/m³. National diabetes screening was 87% of the target, and only 30% of diagnosed patients achieved the recommended blood glucose levels. Maximum temperature was found to non-linearly reduce diabetes screening, particularly between 31.6 °C and 41.9 °C, while no significant association was observed with PM2.5 levels. Temperatures above 32.7 °C were associated with lower proportions of patients achieving recommended blood sugar levels, while lower annual PM2.5 levels (16.4 to 18.8 µg/m³) had similar benefits. Extreme heat was associated with reduced diabetes screening, while PM2.5 showed no significant effect. These findings highlight the need to adapt health service delivery to reduce the impact of heat stress on service utilization. Strategies such as shifting screening services closer to communities, promoting telemedicine, and strengthening the role of primary care and village health volunteers may help maintain access to care during periods of extreme temperature."
Associations Between Environmental Conditions and Infection With Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Japan: A Spatiotemporal Analysis.,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) poses a significant disease burden among children <5 worldwide. Yet systematic analyses of how complex environmental factors are associated with RSV transmission are still lacking in many countries. We introduced a novel 3-stage, data-driven framework to assess the impacts of environmental factors, including meteorological conditions, air pollutants, and extreme weather, on RSV infections from a spatiotemporal perspective. It includes (1) spatiotemporal patterns of RSV transmission; (2) a hierarchical model (HSDLNM) to examine associations between environmental factors and RSV transmission, estimating relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals; and (3) an interpretable machine learning model, Gaussian Process Boosting, to predict RSV infections using historical environmental data. We validated the applicability of the proposed framework in Japan. Weekly data on the number of newly lab-confirmed RSV-positive cases, meteorological factors, and air pollutants were collected from 47 Japanese prefectures (2013-2019). We identified the meteorological thresholds strongly linked to elevated RSV infections, particularly weekly average temperature <10°C (RR, 1.10) or >20°C (RR, 1.13) and weekly average relative humidity <60% (RR, 1.04) or >70% (RR, 1.06). Short-term exposure to particulate matter of 2.5  This study presents the relationships between environmental factors and RSV infections in Japan. Our framework could be applied to areas with similar RSV seasonality to further understand environmental impacts regionally. This research helps inform policy decisions on RSV prophylaxis strategies, supporting cost-effective measures for controlling and preventing early transmission."
Evaluate the impact of PM,"Particulate matter (PM) in air pollution has become a major environmental concern due to its potential health impacts, which vary seasonally and with human activities. While PM is often monitored for concentration, its chemical composition is equally important, especially regarding its effects on the immune system, which remain poorly understood. This study investigates the biological effects of PM2.5 on macrophages collected in different seasons and during COVID-19 restrictions in Taiwan. The experiments revealed significant seasonal variations in metal and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) content in PM2.5, with summer having the highest metal levels and winter the highest PAHs. Exposure to PM2.5 increased cell biotoxicity, correlating with higher PM2.5 concentrations. Further analysis showed that PM2.5 exposure polarized macrophages into the M1 type, triggering inflammatory cytokines, increased ROS levels, cell growth arrest, and apoptosis. Notably, PM2.5 from summer exhibited the highest biotoxicity. The study also identified four metals (Fe, Ti, Co, Sb) as key contributors to biotoxicity. PM2.5 collected during COVID-19 Level 2 Alert showed higher concentrations of these metals, resulting in greater toxicity to macrophages. This research underscores how seasonal changes and human activities influence PM2.5's impact on the immune system, contributing to air pollution control efforts."
Protective effects of natural products against lung damage caused by fine particulate matter.,"A growing body of evidence consistently highlights the substantial risks associated with both acute and chronic exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which significantly increasing the incidence of neurological, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Given that lung health is a critical determinant of overall human well-being, it remains a central focus of medical research. This review investigates the association between PM2.5 exposure and various forms of lung damage, employing both epidemiological and clinical perspectives. Furthermore, the review delves into the molecular mechanisms driving PM2.5-induced lung damage from a toxicological standpoint, with particular attention to oxidative stress, inflammation, and epigenetic modification pathways. A comprehensive review of the literature indicates that natural compounds, including polyphenols, terpenoids, and alkaloids, with known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, could effectively mitigate lung injury, thereby offering promising therapeutic options. This study offers key information into the pathophysiology of PM2.5-related pulmonary diseases and lays the foundation for the development of natural product-based interventions to mitigate lung damage."
Comprehensive insights into the disease burden linked to air pollution exposure across U.S. states: findings from the 2021 Global Burden of Disease Study.,"Ambient air pollution persists as a critical global health threat, ranking fourth among risk factors for premature mortality. Despite decades of air quality improvements in the U.S. through regulatory measures, persistent health impacts remain, driven primarily by particulate matter (PM This study aimed to quantify long-term trends (1990-2021) in air pollution-attributable disease burdens across U.S. states, evaluate the effectiveness of existing policies, and identify priorities for future public health strategies to address persistent and emerging risks. Using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 dataset, we analyzed age-standardized mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years of life lost (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs) attributable to PM From 1990 to 2021, PM"
Assessing the toxicity of traffic-derived air pollution using a primary human air-liquid interface airway in vitro model.,"Traffic-derived air pollution (TDAP) frequently exceeds the 2021 World Health Organization air quality guideline levels and is linked to respiratory diseases through molecular mechanisms such as oxidative stress and inflammation. To determine these mechanisms without relying on animal models and inter-species extrapolation, physiologically relevant human in vitro models are promising tools. We sought to investigate the oxidative stress and inflammatory responses to TDAP in a co-culture model of the human lung. Additionally, we aimed to examine the variability arising from different exposure days and across primary human in vitro models from different donors. Therefore, primary human bronchial epithelial cultures from three donors, each combined with primary alveolar macrophages, were exposed to a continuous flow of ambient TDAP from a high-traffic street in Düsseldorf, Germany on three consecutive days. A versatile aerosol concentration enrichment system was used to increase the fine particulate matter levels from 8 to 42 μg/cm"
"Association between air pollution and non-accidental mortality in Guiyang, China: a time-series analysis (2013-2023).","Air pollution remains one of the leading environmental risk factors for human health globally, significantly contributing to the burden of disease and premature mortality. The relationship between air pollutants and non-accidental deaths in Guiyang was unclear. Descriptive analysis was conducted to characterize air pollutants and mortality trends during the study period. A time-stratified case-crossover design and a quasi-Poisson regression within a generalized additive model (GAM) framework were employed to examine the association between air pollution and mortality. The models incorporated a 7-day lag structure and adjusted for temporal trends, meteorological factors, and day of the week. Analyses were further stratified by cause-specific mortality, age group, sex, and seasonaty as an endpoint for acute health effects, stratified by cause-specific mortality, age, sex and season. SO₂ exposure was associated with a 3.18% (95% CI: 1.95 to 4.42%) increase in excess risk (ER) for non-accidental mortality per 10 μg/m Different pollutants exhibit different lag durations of excess risks and cumulative excess risks for non-accidental mortality and deaths related to circulatory and respiratory systems. Females showed greater susceptible to SO"
Predictive algorithm for COVID-19 infection risk in indoor environments.,"After the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the deep connections between environmental factors and the transmission of airborne infectious diseases (including COVID-19) has become an area of relevant scientific and social interest. Indoor environments, where we spend a significant part of our daily lives, play a crucial role in shaping the dynamics of disease spread. The mitigation of infection risk related to poor indoor air quality and its link with the transmission of airborne diseases has emerged as a focal point for research and intervention strategies. This paper presents the results of a specific collaborative project in this field, focused on the utilization of Internet of Things (IoT) devices for comprehensive indoor environmental monitoring and infectious risk forecasting. In the frame of developing effective countermeasures for COVID-19 and future pandemic preparedness, our primary goal was to develop a predictive model for infection risk in indoor environments. Parameters such as humidity, temperature, CO"

"Perceived Stress, Residential Indoor PM2.5 Concentration, and Motor Vehicle Traffic Exposure Among Adults with Asthma: A Secondary Analysis.","Poorly controlled asthma creates a multitude of health, financial, and quality of life difficulties. The potential influences of environmental factors on the stress levels of people living with asthma-including exposure to fine particulate matter and motor vehicle traffic-are often overlooked. Among a sample of U.S. adults living with poorly controlled asthma, we aimed to determine (1) differences in perceived stress based on self-reported motor vehicle traffic exposure (MVTE), (2) differences in levels of residential indoor fine particulate matter 2.5 microns or less in diameter (PM2.5) based on self-reported MVTE, and (3) associations between residential indoor PM2.5 and perceived stress. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Symptom Science Model for Environmental Health served as the theoretical basis for this study, which is a secondary analysis of data from an NIH-funded feasibility study that examined the effects of residential indoor air quality on asthma symptoms and lung function in adults with uncontrolled asthma. This secondary analysis included data from the feasibility study's baseline survey of 40 participants and indoor PM2.5 data collected continuously over 14 days. Baseline survey data included demographic data, responses to the modified four-item version of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4), and self-reported data on MVTE (dichotomized as low versus medium/high). Participants were primarily female (90%), White (82.5%), college educated (four-year degree or higher, 77.5%), residents of single-family homes (72.5%) in low-MVTE areas (70%), and 26 to 77 years of age. PSS-4 scores ranged from 0 to 14. Participants reporting medium/high MVTE had higher mean PSS-4 scores than those reporting low MVTE, although the difference was not statistically significant (6.5 versus 5.3, respectively; P = 0.305). The median level of indoor PM2.5 concentration (μg/m3) did not differ significantly regardless of whether the MVTE was medium/high or low (3.2 versus 3.6, respectively; P = 0.836). Higher PSS-4 scores were significantly correlated with higher average indoor PM2.5 levels (r = 0.38, P = 0.017). Indoor PM2.5 reduction has important implications for stress management among adults with asthma. Further research is needed to clarify associations between MVTE and indoor pollution."
A systematic review of the pivotal role of environmental toxicant exposure on infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries.,"The objective of this review is to identify which environmental toxicants are linked to infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) by synthesizing available evidence. It aims to summarize key findings, identify research gaps and provide policy recommendations based on the associations between specific toxicants and disease outcomes. Systematic review. We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science (core collection), and CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library) to identify studies on bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogenic activity. This search yielded 11,468 studies, of which 55 met inclusion criteria after screening following the standard methods. A consistent association is found between particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) exposure and increased respiratory infection risk, with PM2.5 particularly linked to increased incidence and mortality in diseases like COVID-19 and tuberculosis. Heavy metals, including lead, cadmium, and mercury worsen chronic infections such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis by increasing body burden and inflammation. The review highlights air pollutants' substantial impact on infectious disease spread and severity while noting a research gap on other pollutants including persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Bias assessment indicates around half the studies show low risk of bias; however, potential biases were noted in confounding variables and blinding of outcome assessment. The systematic review emphasizes the need for research on biological mechanisms underlying these associations and the impacts of other pollutants. Findings advocate for reducing environmental pollution exposure in LMICs to mitigate infectious disease risk."
The air pollutant PM2.5 aggravates airway inflammation via NF-κB/NLRP3-induced pyroptosis: partially inhibited by the TLR4 inhibitor TAK242.,"Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is believed to be closely connected to asthma severity. However, studies are needed to investigate the underlying mechanism of these findings. Our study attempted to confirm the role of NF-κB/NLRP3 pyroptosis in asthma exacerbation through in vivo and in vitro tests. We also analyzed the differentially expressed genes via RNA-Seq to investigate potential regulatory mechanisms. We undertook in vivo and in vitro research to investigate the effects of PM2.5 on a mouse asthma model and the human bronchial epithelial cell line Beas-2b. Female BALB/c mice were sensitized with OVA to create a murine asthma model. HE staining and the EMAK system were used to assess airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness in mouse lungs. We also measured IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and OVA-specific IgE levels to assess the inflammatory effects of PM2.5 on both normal and OVA-induced asthmatic mice. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to analyze the expression of major NF-κB and pyroptosis proteins. Human bronchial epithelial Beas-2b cells were treated with PM2.5, and the degree of pyroptosis was determined. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was employed to identify differentially expressed genes and investigate potential regulatory mechanisms. In vivo exposure to PM2.5 significantly increased HE staining scores in a mouse model of asthma. The levels of acetylcholine associated with enhanced airway responsiveness were lower in the PM2.5-exposed asthmatic group than in the control group. Compared with the asthmatic group, the BALF group presented considerably greater levels of IL-1β and IL-18. Compared with those in the asthmatic group, the protein expression levels of NLRP3, Caspase-1, GSDMD-N, cleaved Caspase-1p10, IL-1β, and p-NF-κBp65/NF-κBp65 in the lung tissues of the mice in the PM2.5 group were significantly greater than those in the asthmatic group. In vitro, PM2.5 causes pyroptosis and inflammation in Beas-2B human bronchial epithelial cells via the NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway. The TLR4 inhibitor TAK242 can partially block this effect. In the OVA-induced asthma mouse model, PM2.5 activates the NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway and induces pyroptosis, thereby exacerbating airway inflammation and hyperreactivity. It may activate the NF-κB signalling cascade through the TLR4/MyD88 pathway, upregulate critical proteins in the pyroptosis pathway, and induce pyroptosis and inflammation in respiratory epithelial Beas-2b cells, exacerbating asthma."

Critical exposure windows of PM2.5-Meteorological interactions triggering pediatric mycoplasma pneumoniae epidemics: An age-stratified distributed lag nonlinear modeling approach.,"The rising prevalence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection (MPI) in children, a leading cause of severe pneumonia and mortality, highlights the need to clarify impacts of air pollution and meteorological factors. This study analyzed associations of PM2.5, temperature, and humidity with outpatient MPI, inpatient MPP, and severe MPP (SMPP). Data on 391,559 children from 15 Northeast China hospitals (2017-2023) were analyzed using a distributed lag nonlinear model, with sensitivity analysis after 2020 (COVID-19 onset). PM2.5 (60-100 μg/m High PM2.5, high temperature, and extreme humidity correlate with increased childhood MPI cases and severity, emphasizing targeted strategies for extreme conditions."
A study on the correlation between regional airborne particulate concentration and asthma occurrence based on an open database and time series prediction.,"Air pollution has become an issue of concern in recent years. The rapid development of modern technology and industrial carbon emissions has led to an increase in suspended particles in the air. This is of particular concern in Taiwan, where the focus on high-tech industries, whether semiconductor manufacturing or printed circuit board manufacturing, produces pollutants that are harmful to the environment. Asthma is an important issue both in the past and today. The clinical care guidelines for adult asthma issued in 2022 state that the prevalence of asthma in Taiwan was 12% for adults and 15% for children. Based on these estimates, there are approximately 2 million asthma patients in Taiwan, which creates a serious burden on healthcare resources. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between regional airborne particles and asthma, to determine which airborne particles are most associated with asthma, and to ascertain the degree of correlation between the two through the statistical method of correlation analysis. A weak positive correlation was found between PM10 and the number of asthma emergencies. A time series model was also used to predict PM2.5 and PM10 levels and the number of asthma emergencies, which can be used as a reference for the number of asthma consultations and as a basis for evaluating the allocation of healthcare resources."
A post-pandemic analysis of air pollution over small-sized urban areas in southern Thailand following the COVID-19 lockdown.,"COVID-19 has been a pandemic with paramount effects on human health that brought about a noticeable improvement of air quality due to a reduction of anthropogenic activities. While studying this phenomenon in large cities has been a popular research topic, related research on smaller-sized urban areas has not been given the necessary attention. In the current study, we focus on the period during and after the COVID-19 pandemic over 8 small- and medium-sized urban areas in southern Thailand and present the effect of the lockdown on the air quality as quantified by the Sentinel-5P satellite and regulatory-grade surface stations over the years 2020, 2021 and 2022. Findings indicate that there is a noticeable reduction of -14%, -24% and -28% for NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 surface concentrations, respectively, for all the 8 urban areas cumulatively for the 2-month period following the lockdown, while results for O3 were inconclusive. An alignment between the ground and satellite observations is noticed, despite their difference in spatial scales and measuring different physical characteristics. Regression analysis between the single-pixel values over the ground station locations and the spatially-averaged pixels over the urban extent indicates an agreement between these two features, suggesting that single measurements can be representative of the air pollution status for relatively small-sized urban areas."
Urbanization and childhood asthma.,"Childhood asthma is one of the major public health concerns, and urbanization as well as worsening environmental factors are contributing to its increasing prevalence. Outdoor pollutants, such as PM2.5, ozone, and traffic-related air pollution or TRAP, play significant roles in exacerbating asthmatic symptoms in children as well as reducing their lung function. Climate change can further compound these effects with changing pollen patterns that increase exposure to allergens in certain geographical areas. Moreover, indoor environments in urban areas also expose children to pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, and aeroallergens like cockroach or mouse allergens. Socioeconomic disparities can further amplify these effects, with children in minority or low-income households disproportionately burdened by asthma morbidity. Green infrastructure and technological innovations can offer mitigation opportunities for negative effects of urbanization but require careful implementation to address multifactorial contributors to childhood asthma. Our review highlights the need for integrated strategies regarding environmental regulation, urban planning, and targeted interventions to reduce asthma burden in the urban pediatric population."
Astragaloside II pretreatment alleviates PM2.5-induced lung injury in mice via MAPK/Nrf2/GPX4 axis-mediated suppression of ferroptosis.,"Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) induces inflammation and oxidative stress, contributing to respiratory diseases, including lung injury. Astragaloside II (AS II), a natural product derived from Astragali Radix (AR), demonstrates dual anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. This work systematically evaluates AS II's prophylactic efficacy and molecular pathways in mitigating PM2.5-triggered pulmonary damage using a murine model. Intratracheal PM2.5 suspension (7.5 mg/kg) was applied, with AS II (25 and 50 mg/kg) pretreated via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection before the pollutant challenge. Results demonstrated that AS II alleviated PM2.5-induced lung injury, mitigated pulmonary edema and inflammation, and reduced levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β). AS II upregulated glutathione (GSH) and catalase (CAT) levels while downregulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Mechanistically, AS II inhibited the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway, activated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), enhanced expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and elevated other antioxidant proteins while suppressing ferroptosis and oxidative stress markers. To further validate the role of ferroptosis, RSL3-a small-molecule ferroptosis agonist that binds and inactivates GPX4-was employed. The protective efficacy of AS II against lung injury was effectively counteracted by RSL3-induced GPX4 inactivation. Collectively, AS II protects against PM2.5-induced pulmonary injury by modulating the MAPK/NRF2/GPX4 signaling axis to inhibit ferroptosis, thereby providing a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PM2.5-associated pulmonary diseases."
Source apportionment and dynamics of PM,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was reported to improve air quality. However, the effects of lockdown on PM₂.₅ and its chemical components based on source-specific characteristics remain unclear. This study evaluated and compared the components of PM₂.₅ across three target sites-Seoul, Ansan-Siheung, and Wonju-based on source distribution patterns during the pandemic and post-pandemic periods. The results revealed that total ion concentrations decreased by 7-19% at the target sites, while trace element concentrations increased by 19-29% in the post-pandemic period. Carbon concentrations showed region-specific trends. Components associated with secondary formation, such as SO₄²⁻, NO₃⁻, and NH₄⁺, decreased, whereas natural-origin components, such as Cl⁻, Na⁺, Mg²⁺, and Ca²⁺, increased, indicating enhanced dust resuspension. Furthermore, a positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis demonstrated a predominance of primary emission sources and resuspended dust in the post-pandemic period, with a decline in contributions from secondary formation sources. These regional variations were primarily influenced by the extent of socioeconomic activities, with Seoul exhibiting a higher contribution from primary emissions and suspended dust. This study emphasizes the importance of establishing region-specific air quality improvement policies by scientifically identifying the impacts of anthropogenic activity on PM₂.₅ components and their sources."
Association Between US Wildfires and Health Care Utilization for Acute Rhinosinusitis.,"Wildfires (WF), a major contributor to air pollution including ambient particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), have been shown to increase the risk of developing sinonasal diseases. This study assesses the impact of WF on health care claims for acute rhinosinusitis (ARS). Utilizing national WF geospatial records and EPA-based smoke-PM2.5 databases, we identified core-based statistical areas (CBSAs) affected by WF >50,000 acres, occurring between 2014 and 2019. We correlated WF events with MarketScan health care claims data, calculating daily outpatient visit proportions relative to total visits per CBSA for ARS, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), rhinitis, and asthma. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) by comparing visit proportions in pre-WF versus post-WF periods, adjusted for seasonality by comparison to non-WF periods in the same CBSAs. Cross-correlation (CC) analysis was conducted to determine the temporal relationship between daily smoke-PM2.5 and ARS-visit proportions. Sixteen WFs events from nine CBSAs were captured, yielding 2.22 M claims. ARS visit proportions increased in the 2 months post-WF periods, with an RR of 1.17 (confidence interval = 1.12‒1.22). CRS and rhinitis showed no significant increase in RR. Control analysis (2.08 M claims) yielded an RR of 0.97 (0.93‒1.082) for non-WF ARS-visit proportions. CC analysis indicated a significant correlation (0.4 ± 0.04; p < 0.001) with a lag of 33 ± 3 days. WF smoke exposure is associated with increased health care utilization for ARS in the 2 months post-exposure."

The effects of long-term co-exposure to nanocarbon black particles and benzo[a]pyrene on ROS levels and the AKT/P27 signaling pathway in BEAS-2B cells.,"Long-term co-exposure to nanocarbon black particles (NCBP) and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), as major components of PM2.5, may contribute to respiratory diseases by inducing oxidative damage. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their synergistic effects remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the impact of long-term co-exposure to NCBP and B[a]P on reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and the protein kinase B (AKT)/cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (P27) signaling pathway in human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) cells. Cytotoxicity concentrations of NCBP and B[a]P for BEAS-2B cells were screened using the cell counting kit-8 assay and applied to subsequent long-term exposure experiments. Intracellular ROS levels were measured via fluorescent probe assay. Western blot was performed to analyze the expression of AKT/P27 pathway-related proteins (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phosphorylated AKT [p-AKT], total AKT, and P27). The regulatory relationship between the pathway and P27 was validated using an AKT inhibitor, and statistical analysis was conducted to evaluate significance. Significant reductions in cell viability (P < .05) were observed at concentrations of 16 μM B[a]P and 80 μg/mL NCBP. Long-term co-exposure to NCBP and B[a]P-induced ROS accumulation (P < .05). Western blot revealed upregulated p-AKT expression (P < .05) and significant suppression of P27 (P < .05) in the co-exposure group. Inhibition of p-AKT by an AKT inhibitor reversed the downregulation of P27 induced by co-exposure (P < .05), indicating that P27 is a downstream target of the AKT pathway. Compared to single exposures, co-exposure exhibited stronger synergistic effects on oxidative stress dysregulation. Long-term co-exposure to NCBP and B[a]P exacerbates oxidative damage in BEAS-2B cells by activating the AKT signaling pathway, suppressing P27 expression, and promoting ROS accumulation. This study elucidates potential mechanisms of multi-pollutant synergistic effects, providing new insights for health risk assessment of environmental co-exposure."
Particulate Matter 2.5 Induces FGFR1-mediated Integrin Switch to Promote Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Metastasis.,"Particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) is known to adversely affect human health. While its involvement in lung cancer pathogenesis is recognized, its specific impact on metastasis-related behaviors of lung cancer cells remains largely unexplored. In this study, we employed cell culture models, proteomic analysis, and bioinformatic analysis. Target proteins and signaling pathways were validated using western blotting and immunofluorescence assay. Wound healing, transwell migration and phalloidin-rhodamine assays were used to determine the migratory activity. Proteomic analysis identified 3,795 proteins in both control and PM2.5-treated groups. Among these, proteins associated with metastasis, particularly those related to ""cell migration"" (GO: 0016477), were highlighted, identifying six key proteins involved in cancer metastasis. Protein-protein interaction analysis pinpointed fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) as a central target influenced by PM2.5, which promoted cell migration  These results indicate that FGFR1 is a crucial target in PM2.5-induced metastasis in lung cancer cells, operating through an FGFR1/integrin/Akt signaling axis. This study advances our understanding of the role of PM2.5 in lung cancer metastasis and suggests potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate cancer progression."
Effect of exposure to ambient particulate matter on risk of developing pulmonary tuberculosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health challenge, particularly in polluted areas. The relationship between ambient particulate matter and TB risk remains unclear, making this systematic review and meta-analysis (SRMA) vital for assessing this link. This SRMA aimed to estimate the association between exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and the risk of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) infection. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane (English-language studies) on January 29, 2024. The review followed PRISMA Guidelines (2020) for comprehensive literature searches, data extraction, and quality assessment of included studies. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis to estimate pooled effect sizes and assess heterogeneity. Study quality and publication bias were also evaluated. Of the 507 articles identified, 25 met the inclusion criteria. Long-term PM2.5 exposure was linked to a 26% increase in PTB risk (RR =1.26, 95% CI: 1.07-1.48), while short-term exposure raised the risk by 10% (RR =1.10, 95% CI: 0.98-1.25). Long-term PM10 exposure increased PTB risk by 7% (RR =1.07, 95% CI: 1.02-1.12), with short-term exposure showing a similar increase (RR =1.07, 95% CI: 0.95-1.17). Subgroup analysis revealed PTB risk increased by 15% in males and 29% in females for PM2.5, and by 10% in males and 7% in females for PM10. A 10 µg/m³ increase in Particulate matter is associated with a higher risk of pulmonary tuberculosis, highlighting the need for targeted public health measures to reduce particulate exposure, especially in high-risk urban and industrial areas."

Global burden of disease study on COPD in the older adult: comprehensive analysis of environmental factors and interaction effects.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading global health issue, ranking fourth in mortality in 2021 per GBD 2021, with older adults most at risk due to aging-related vulnerabilities. Environmental factors like air pollution and temperature extremes are key contributors, with evidence suggesting their interaction worsens COPD. As the older adult population is projected to reach 2.1 billion by 2050, understanding these impacts is vital for public health. Using GBD 2021 data, we analyzed COPD burden in older adults (1990-2021) due to air pollution and non-optimal temperature. Joinpoint regression and Bayesian models assessed trends in age-standardized mortality (ASMR) and disability-adjusted life year (ASDR) rates globally, regionally, and nationally. Spearman's correlation evaluated socio-demographic index (SDI) associations, and standardized exposure value (SEV) data examined air pollution-temperature interactions. Globally, most environmental COPD burdens declined or stabilized, but high temperature burdens rose (AAPC > 0,  This study reveals shifting COPD burdens, with ambient PM2.5 and high temperatures emerging as key challenges, particularly in lower-SDI areas. Synergistic air pollution-temperature effects highlight the need for integrated policies. These findings support targeted interventions to reduce COPD burden and enhance health equity in aging populations."
High-resolution mapping of residential wood burning heat sources using Energy Performance Certificates: A case study of England and Wales.,"Particulate matter emissions from residential wood burning are rising in many countries. Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter is strongly linked with adverse health effects including cardiovascular and respiratory disease. Policymakers and scientists need accurate tools to identify residential wood burning hotspots. However, current methods rely on spatially-misaligned, out-of-date data sources, reducing their practical utility and portability to other contexts. Furthermore, the socio-economic characteristics of residential wood burning in high income countries are poorly understood. We used open data from 26 million Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) for properties in England and Wales from 2009-2025 to map the concentration and prevalence of wood burners within small areas. We evaluated our method against the UK national wood burning emissions inventory using national air pollution monitoring networks. We used novel open data linkages to characterise associations between area-level prevalence of wood burners and socio-economic factors including deprivation, ethnicity, and age. We identified substantial spatial heterogeneity in the concentration of wood burners, with the highest concentrations in affluent urban areas. Our concentration metric was more strongly correlated with peaks in winter PM2.5 at urban monitoring sites than estimates from the UK national emissions inventory. Prevalence of wood burners was positively correlated with age and negatively correlated with measures of social deprivation. Prevalence of wood burners in EPCs has increased since 2009. EPCs are a valuable data source which policymakers can use to target local interventions or extend existing restrictions on solid fuel burning. Our method is transparent, up-to-date, and portable to other countries where similar EPC data is available. The relationship between social deprivation and prevalence of wood burning heat sources highlights important issues of environmental justice. Epidemiological analyses of wood smoke exposures and health should carefully account for the confounding effects of age, deprivation, and ethnicity."
