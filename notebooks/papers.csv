"Cancer statistics in China: Epidemiology, risk factors, and prevention.","Cancer is a leading cause of death in China, and its epidemiological profile has shifted markedly in recent years. This review summarizes contemporary trends in cancer incidence and mortality, delineates the major modifiable risk factors, and highlights recent national efforts to ease the burden of cancer. In 2022, China recorded 4.8 million new cancer cases (crude rate: 341.7 per 100,000) and 2.5 million cancer deaths (182.3 per 100,000). Lung, colorectal, thyroid, liver, stomach, and female breast cancers accounted for 65% of all diagnoses, while lung, liver, stomach, colorectal, and esophageal cancers constituted 67.5% of cancer deaths. Notable shifts in sex-specific rankings underscored the rising mortality burden of prostate, female breast, and cervical cancers. China has made measurable progress in cancer control. Between 2000 and 2018, the age-standardized mortality rate for all cancers declined by approximately 1.3% annually, and the age-standardized 5-year relative survival improved from 30.9% in 2003-2005 to 43.7% in 2019-2021. According to Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2023, nearly half of cancer deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were attributable to modifiable risk factors such as tobacco, air pollution, high alcohol use, dietary risks, and unsafe sex. In response, the government has implemented a suite of prevention-oriented policies, including expansion of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, strengthened tobacco control, sustained air pollution reduction, enhanced health education, and broadened cancer screening coverage. Collectively, these initiatives demonstrate a sustained national commitment to reducing the cancer burden."
Bronchoalveolar Lavage as a Diagnostic Window into Human Exposure to Microplastics and Associated Lung Changes.,"Microplastics are emerging airborne pollutants increasingly implicated in respiratory health risks. Although ingestion has been widely studied, inhalation of microplastics and their potential pulmonary impact remain underexplored. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) provides a minimally invasive diagnostic technique for detecting inhaled particles and assessing associated inflammatory changes. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 60 adult patients undergoing diagnostic bronchoscopy for non-infective pulmonary complaints. BAL fluid was collected and filtered to detect microplastics using polarized light microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Cytological examination and cytokine analysis (IL-6, TNF-α) were also performed. Data were statistically analyzed using SPSS v25, with significance set at  Microplastics were detected in 70% of BAL samples, with polyethylene and polypropylene being the most common types. The mean microplastic count was 6.4 ± 3.1 particles per 100 mL BALF. Individuals with detectable microplastics showed significantly higher macrophage (65.4% vs. 58.6%,  Bronchoalveolar lavage is a valuable tool for detecting pulmonary microplastic exposure and related inflammatory changes. These findings underscore the potential health risks posed by airborne microplastics and support the need for environmental and occupational health interventions."

Epigenome-wide association study of household air pollution exposure in an area with high lung cancer incidence.,"Lung cancer incidence among never-smoking women in Xuanwei, China, is among the highest worldwide and is primarily attributed to household air pollution (HAP) from smoky (bituminous) coal combustion, with early-life exposure identified as playing a critical role. We conducted epigenome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) analyses of HAP exposure and its polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) constituents across exposure windows. Leukocyte DNAm was measured in 106 never-smoking women, including 23 individuals with repeated measurements. Cooking fuel use and stove type was obtained through questionnaire, and comprehensive personal and environmental air monitoring was conducted. Validated exposure models estimated 43 HAP constituents, predominantly PAHs, across childhood, current, and cumulative exposure windows, and PAH clusters were derived via hierarchical clustering. Generalized estimating equations were used to identify CpG sites associated with HAP exposure and PAH clusters, including 5-methylchrysene, a methylated PAH previously linked to lung cancer. We identified several differentially methylated CpG sites, predominantly hypomethylated with higher HAP exposure. Although some DNAm signatures overlapped with those observed in smoking, the majority were distinct. Notably, higher current exposure to 5-methylchrysene was significantly associated with hypomethylation at cg05575921 (AHRR; p = 2.05x10"
"Global, regional, and national burden of chronic respiratory diseases and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, 1990-2023: a Global Burden of Disease study.","Chronic respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pneumoconiosis, interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary sarcoidosis, are major global causes of mortality and morbidity. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced acute respiratory health, its impact on chronic respiratory conditions remains unclear. We estimated the global, regional and national burden of chronic respiratory diseases from 1990 to 2023, including risk factors, and evaluated how these burdens have shifted during the COVID-19 pandemic using the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023. In 2023, chronic respiratory diseases accounted for 569.2 million (95% uncertainty interval (UI), 508.8-639.8) cases and 4.2 million (3.6-5.1) deaths. The age-standardized death rate declined by 25.7% globally from 1990 to 2023 despite an increase in ILD and pulmonary sarcoidosis. Mortality declined in younger males, especially for asthma, whereas older adults experienced a rise in ILD and pulmonary sarcoidosis. Smoking was the primary risk factor for COPD, whereas high body mass index and silica exposure were key risk factors for asthma and pneumoconiosis. During the pandemic, the incidence of chronic respiratory diseases increased modestly, but the decline in mortality rates became more pronounced, highlighting the need for sustained global attention and action to address their long-term burden."
"Mapping three decades of air pollution-lung cancer research: trends, hotspots, and networks (1990-2025).","The relationship between air pollution and lung cancer has attracted considerable attention from researchers worldwide. To systematically assess the scholarly landscape and pinpoint research fronts, this study employs bibliometric analysis to delineate global trends, collaborative networks, and key publications within this field. Publications from 1990 to 2025 were extracted from Web of Science Core Collection and Scopus databases. Bibliometric tools including VOSViewer, Citespace, and Bibliometrix R were used to examine trends, key contributors, research themes, and prominent journals. Among 4,238 publications, citation rates rose significantly. China produced the most publications, with leading institutions such as Harvard University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Key researchers included Lan Q, Rothman N, and Vermeulen R. Major journals were Environmental Health Perspectives and Atmospheric Environment. Frequently used keywords like ""Lung Cancer"" and ""Particulate Matter"" indicate core themes, while emerging terms such as ""Covid-19"" and ""Machine Learning"" reflect evolving interests. Fine particulate matter is an established environmental risk factor for lung cancer, and research on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and asbestos remains active. The field has shifted from exposure assessment to mechanistic investigations focusing on oxidative stress, gene expression, and machine learning applications, defining key future research directions."
Effects of Air Pollution Exposure and the MUC5B rs35705950 Variant on Interstitial Lung Disease Risk in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis.,"Rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis share common risk factors, including the MUC5B promoter variant (rs35705950). We examined the contribution of air pollutants to ILD risk in an RA population and assessed the modifying effect of genetic susceptibility. This study included patients with RA who had undergone chest HRCT. MUC5B status was collected when available. Exposure levels to NO We included 594 patients with RA (mean age: 58 ± 12 years, 71% women, 44% current or ex-smokers), of whom 227 (38%) had ILD and 292 patients were genotyped for MUC5B rs35705950. Increased long-term exposure to NO Long-term exposure to air pollution is an independent risk factor for RA-ILD and its effect may be modified according to MUC5B rs35705950 genotype."

Google Trends as a health sentinel. ALERT study: Analyzing Symptoms Perceptions Related To Environmental pollution.,"The relationship between environmental pollution and human health is well-documented, and exposure has been linked to an increased risk of respiratory and psychological diseases. In our clinical practice, a trend of self-medication and self-diagnosis has emerged, defined as independent web searches for self-reported symptoms aimed at obtaining a diagnosis and related treatment in the absence of medical advice. This study aims to investigate the relationship between air pollution and public health, focusing on the impact of particulate matter (PM 2.5, PM 10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and other pollutants on respiratory and mental health, and their relationship with web searches for health-related topics. The study compares search trends for specific terms (e.g., cough, dyspnea, asthma, etc.), obtained using Google Trends, a tool for assessing public interest in health-related issues, with air main pollutants concentrations collected over the same period in 2024 in Genoa, Liguria region. Correlation between searches for cough and levels of PM 2.5, O3, benzene, and NO2 was established, while depression also showed a connection to PM 2.5 and benzene. These findings underscore the potential of Google Trends as a valuable resource for epidemiological surveillance. The study highlights the necessity for healthcare systems to adapt to the implications of air quality on health outcomes. It emphasizes the need for innovative approaches, including real-time tracking of air pollution and its health impacts, to enhance patient care and inform clinical practice. The integration of technology and data analytics in healthcare is proposed as a forward-looking strategy to improve therapeutic adherence and patient management in the context of environmental health challenges."
Effects of inflammatory markers and sleep quality in stroke patients by reducing residential PM,"To assess the health impacts of a home intervention involving protective window screens and air purifiers on stroke patients in typical residential buildings in southern Taiwan. Chronic ischemic stroke patients were recruited from hospitals in southern Taiwan. A crossover study design was used, with home interventions consisting of protective window screens alone and protective window screens combined with air purifiers. Environmental monitoring indicators (indoor and outdoor PM Eleven cases (male:female = 9:2) were completed. The proportion of time with indoor PM Residential installation of protective window screens reduced indoor PM2.5, improved air quality, and positively influenced inflammatory markers and sleep in stroke patients in this case-crossover study. Further research is recommended to investigate its practical implementation and effectiveness in real-world residential settings."
Ambient air pollution and survival in SCLC/LCNEC: Analysis of a single centre retrospective cohort.,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung (LCNEC) are the deadliest forms of lung cancer with dismal prognosis. Recent evidence suggests that, beyond cigarette smoke, air pollution can have a role in the pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is associated with poorer survival. However, whether air pollutants exposure could affect survival outcomes in SCLC/LCNEC is unknown. We retrospectively analysed data from SCLC/LCNEC cases observed in the province of Brescia province Brescia between 2017 and 2021. Air pollutants mean concentrations were calculated during the same timeframe and the Brescia province was divided in six subareas dichotomized into lightly and heavily polluted areas based on the mean PM We observed 221 cases of SCLC/LCNEC, accounting for about 18 % of new lung cancer cases. Residency in heavily polluted areas (HR 1.51, p = 0.03) and extensive stage disease at diagnosis (HR 2.47, p = 0.0001) emerged as independent factors for poorer survival. Exploratory analyses showed an association between the distribution of SCLC/LCNEC cases and higher PM These results indicate that long-term exposure to high levels of PM"
The Prevalence of Lung Carcinoma Among the Population in Bulgaria and Its Association with Radon Exposure in Residential Buildings.,"Lung carcinoma remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with smoking as the primary risk factor and radon exposure as the second, and the first among non-smokers. The combined effect of tobacco smoke and indoor radon increases disease risk up to 2.5 times, emphasizing the need for prevention and environmental risk assessment. This study analyzed the incidence of lung carcinoma in Bulgaria during 2013-2022 and examined its association with indoor radon exposure across different regions. Annual data were obtained from the National Statistical Institute and the National Survey of Indoor Radon Concentrations in Residential Buildings (2015-2016). The average annual incidence was 43.5 per 100,000 population, showing a 3.4% annual decline, while the average prevalence was 131.7 per 100,000, decreasing by 1.4% per year. Considerable interregional variation was observed, with incidence ranging from 25.5 to 62.4 per 100,000. A moderate positive correlation was found between lung carcinoma incidence and mean indoor radon concentration, and a stronger to very strong correlation with the proportion of dwellings exceeding 300 Bq/m These findings indicate a positive association between residential radon exposure and lung cancer morbidity and support maintaining the WHO-recommended reference level of 200 Bq/m"
Molecular interactions and dynamics of microplastics in indoor dust with lung-inflammatory receptors: A study in academic settings.,"Airborne microplastics (MPs) are prevalent indoors, and due to their low aerodynamic diameter, they can be inhaled, posing potential health risks. Although the toxic effects of airborne MPs have been explored using in vivo and in vitro models, the interactions between MPs and cellular receptors remain understudied. In this research, dust samples from a confined space within an academic setting were investigated for microplastics (MPs) and their abundance. Further, the most prevalent microplastics were used to study receptor binding and competition interaction studies using the In-Silico method against natural agonists and antagonists of major inflammatory receptors, including the human platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR), C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 1 (CXCR1), β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR), and toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2). Results revealed that polyester (PE) was the predominant polymer, accounting for 23.96 % of the samples. Analysis indicated that a monomer of PET, Ethylene Terephthalate (ET), exhibited a high binding affinity of -6.5 kcal/mol with the PAFR receptor. Additionally, the molecular dynamics and protein-ligand interaction study, which involves hydrogen bonding, explains the differential binding effect of ET and the control compound with the targeted receptor. The complex was formed between the ET and the receptors of β2-AR, CXCR1, and TLR-2, with a maximum of seven and a minimum of one hydrogen bond throughout the simulation. This research lays a foundation for understanding the potential health implications of MPs in confined office spaces, underscoring the need for further in vivo and in vitro examinations."
Health-economic impact of implementing continuous vital sign monitoring in post-surgical patients in five European countries.,"Hospitals, in particular intensive care units (ICUs), account for a large proportion of healthcare costs and environmental burden. Preventing unexpected patient transfer to ICU  A health-economic, decision-tree model was developed to compare CVSM versus intermittent monitoring for costs, resources, and environmental consequences up to 30 days after hospital discharge for a hypothetical, 100-patient cohort. Hospital data from the UK were used to populate the initial country model, while data were extracted from the literature for Netherlands, Germany, Spain, and France. Key outcomes were costs (in 2024 currency), days in hospital, and environmental impact (kg of CO For 100 patients, the cost savings with use of CVSM ranged from -€111,381 (95% CrI = -35,164; -159,176) in the Netherlands to -€22,745 (95% CrI = -7,656; -44,134) in France. In no country did the range of the 95% CrI cross zero, indicating significant cost savings with CVSM. Cost savings mainly resulted from reductions of ICU days, which ranged from -25 (95% CrI = 8; -43) in Germany to -9 (95% CrI = -1; -28) in France. Changes in ICU days were not always significant. On average, 3,866 kg of CO Published data was limited and data was proxied across countries when unavailable. CVSM is expected to be a cost-saving, sustainable solution for most hospitals of the countries included. Following surgery, it is important to notice any new health problems as soon as they begin, so that they can be treated quickly. If a patient gets heart problems or is getting worse and at risk of a heart attack, and they do not get immediate treatment, they may have to stay longer in the hospital. Long hospital stays are expensive and impact the environment by increasing air pollution and trash. Usually, nurses check on patients several times every day, measuring heart rate, breathing rate, and other vital signs. Continuous vital sign monitoring (CVSM) technology allows healthcare professionals to ongoingly measure patients’ vital signs, without a gap lasting for hours between measurements. This can contribute to detecting patient worsening ahead of time and preventing health problems. This study calculated how CVSM can support hospitals in five European countries. New data were collected from British hospitals. Data for other countries were found in published scientific articles. The data were used to estimate how CVSM changes how long patients stay in the hospital and in intensive care, how much money treating the patients cost, and the environmental effect. Using CVSM saves money and reduces environmental burden in each country, but by different amounts. CVSM would allow 100 patients to overall spend 9 fewer days in the intensive care unit in France, and 25 fewer days in the intensive care unit in Germany. Per 100 patients, CVSM would save €22,745 in France and €111,381 in the Netherlands."
Gut-lung axis in allergic rhinitis: microbial dysbiosis and therapeutic strategies.,"Allergic rhinitis (AR) affects an estimated 10%-30% of people worldwide and places a significant burden on both health and healthcare systems. Recent research suggests that imbalances in the gut microbiota may contribute to the development of AR by disrupting immune regulation along the gut-lung axis. However, these insights have yet to be fully translated into clinical practice. We performed a systematic review of studies published between 2010 and 2025, including clinical research, animal experiments, and multi-omics analyses, retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, CNKI, and Wanfang databases. The review aimed to evaluate immune mechanisms mediated by the gut microbiota and assess microbiota-targeted interventions in AR. Patients with AR consistently show reduced fecal butyrate levels, with several studies reporting significant declines, alongside elevated serum IgE concentrations. These changes are closely linked to gut dysbiosis, characterized by reduced abundance of  Gut dysbiosis contributes to the development of AR by disrupting immune-metabolic pathways along the gut-lung axis. Microbiota-targeted interventions hold promise for both the prevention and management of AR, especially in pediatric populations. To achieve long-term impact, public health strategies that combine dietary modifications with measures to reduce air pollution are urgently needed."
Proteomic signatures of smoking and their associations with risk of incident diseases and mortality in diverse populations.,"Smoking is the most important behavioural determinant of morbidity and mortality. Using machine learning on plasma levels of 2,917 proteins in the UK Biobank (n = 43,914), we develop a proteomic Smoking Index (pSIN) comprising 51 proteins that accurately distinguish current from never smokers (AUC = 0.95; 95% CI 0.94-0.95). Validation in the China Kadoorie Biobank (n = 3,977) shows similar accuracy (AUC = 0.91; 95% CI 0.89-0.92). pSIN is significantly associated with the risk of all-cause mortality and 18 major chronic diseases, including cardiovascular, renal, pulmonary, neurodegenerative, and cancer outcomes. Among current and former smokers, pSIN predicts death and 11 diseases independently of self-reported smoking history and lifestyle factors. Genome-wide analysis identifies 125 genes (e.g., ALPP, CST5, IL12B) associated with pSIN, while exposome analysis highlights maternal smoking, diet, physical activity, and air pollution as key modifiers. Notably, pSIN tracks recovery among former smokers and identifies those whose disease risks remain comparable to current smokers. These findings demonstrate that plasma proteomics effectively capture the biological imprint of smoking and predict smoking-related morbidity and mortality, offering a more nuanced, molecularly grounded assessment of individual variation in biological response to smoking."
Air pollution and lung cancer in India: an escalating public health crisis.,
The impact of environmental exposures on DNA methylation in the EXPANSE project.,"Living in an urban environment exposes the population to a mix of environmental and social factors, known as the Urban Exposome, that can influence health via changes in DNA methylation. We hypothesised that linking urban exposures with epigenome-wide DNA methylation in blood can reveal impacts across the lifespan. In the EXPANSE project, we conducted an inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies of seven European cohorts. Urban exposures were estimated at participants' home addresses and included air pollution (PM2.5, NO DNA methylation was measured in blood samples from 1778 children (4-10 years), 878 adolescents (16 years), and 5975 adults (18-87 years). PM2.5, NO Urban environmental factors induce DNA methylation changes across life stages, with stronger associations in young children and adults. We observed a distinct contrast in the methylation changes associated with greenness compared to other urban environmental factors. However, disentangling exposure-specific methylome signatures remains a challenge. This work was supported by the EXPANSE project, funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 874627."
Greater ambient air pollution exposure is associated with worse respiratory symptoms in men and women with HIV and chronic lung disease: a cohort study.,"COPD and impairment in diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) are common comorbidities in people with HIV (PWH). HIV may increase susceptibility to inhaled toxins including air pollution. In PWH and people without HIV (PWoH), we investigated whether air pollution exposure was associated with within-group differences in lung function or respiratory symptoms, and whether these associations differed by HIV serostatus or the presence of underlying lung disease. We analyzed cross-sectional data from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) and the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), including participants with pulmonary function tests and accompanying standardized respiratory questionnaires in 2017–2020. The participants were linked to fine particulate matter (PM 338 MACS participants and 1073 WIHS participants were included. Overall, there were no significant associations between pollution exposures and either lung function or respiratory symptoms.

"Association between weather, air quality and asthma-related emergency department visits: a retrospective time-series study in Singapore.","To evaluate the association between asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits and weather, air quality, monsoons, haze and cultural festivals in Singapore. Retrospective cohort study. A public healthcare cluster that covers 20% of the nation's adult asthma population. 2617 adult patients accounting for 5337 asthma ED visits between 2016 and 2024. Temperature, rainfall, wet bulb temperature (WBT), wind speed and Pollution Standards Index (PSI) were correlated with asthma ED counts at 0-7 day lags. Associations between ED visits and monsoons, transboundary haze and cultural festivals were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance. Weekly seasonal ARIMA models with exogenous regressors were fitted, incorporating PSI as a covariate and adjusting for demographic, clinical and socioeconomic factors. Asthma ED visits were positively correlated with PSI (lag 0: r=0.142; 95% CI 0.107 to 0.178) and inversely correlated with rainfall (lag 3: r=-0.062; 95% CI -0.099 to -0.026) and WBT (lag 1: r=-0.067; 95% CI -0.104 to -0.031). Wind speed (lag 2: r=-0.049; 95% CI -0.086 to -0.013) and ambient temperature (lag 6: r=-0.045; 95% CI -0.081 to -0.008) showed weaker inverse associations. Mean PSI was higher during haze (82.67 vs 51.46, p<0.001) and festival periods (53.42 vs 51.57, p=0.001). Mean ED visits fell across successive haze events (2.60 in 2016, 2.36 in 2019, 1.46 in 2023) but peaked during the Northeast monsoons despite lower PSI, indicating weather influences beyond ambient pollution. PSI-ED association peaked on the same day of exposure but was no longer significant after adjusting for demographic and clinical factors. Pollution-linked festivals, transboundary haze and the Northeast monsoon were associated with increased asthma ED visits."
Acrylonitrile exposure incurs lung function decline: Insights from lifestyle intervention and mechanistic pathway in an urban prospective cohort.,"Acrylonitrile (AN), a prevalent Urban Air Toxic Pollutant, has drawn growing worldwide attention due to its alarming health threat. Evidence regarding the respiratory effect of AN exposure and its interaction with lifestyle in the general population remains limited, and the underlying mechanisms are largely unexplored. In this urban population-based prospective cohort study (baseline: 2011-2012; two follow-ups: 2014-2015 and 2017-2018), urinary AN metabolite N-Acetyl-S-(2-cyanoethyl)-L-cysteine (CYMA) and lung function were repeatedly measured for 6236 observations of 3515 participants. We utilized linear mixed models to evaluate the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between CYMA and lung function. Interaction plots were depicted to estimate the interaction of CYMA with healthy lifestyle score (HLS). Biomarkers of inflammation (plasma transforming growth factor-β [TGF-β], C-reactive protein, and club cell secretory protein) and oxidative damage to DNA (urinary 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine [8-OHdG]), lipid (urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin-F Cross-sectionally, each one-unit increase in log Daily life exposure to AN was associated with lung function decline. Mitigating AN pollution, promoting healthy lifestyles, and targeting fibro-inflammation, oxidative DNA damage, and lipid peroxidation pathways could be effective strategies to safeguard the public respiratory health."
"Global burden of lower respiratory infections and aetiologies, 1990-2023: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023.","Lower respiratory infections (LRIs) remain the world's leading infectious cause of death. This analysis from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2023 provides global, regional, and national estimates of LRI incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), with attribution to 26 pathogens, including 11 newly modelled pathogens, across 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2023. With new data and revised modelling techniques, these estimates serve as an update and expansion to GBD 2021. Through these estimates, we also aimed to assess progress towards the 2025 Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Pneumonia and Diarrhoea (GAPPD) target for pneumonia mortality in children younger than 5 years. Mortality from LRIs, defined as physician-diagnosed pneumonia or bronchiolitis, was estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model with data from vital registration, verbal autopsy, surveillance, and minimally invasive tissue sampling. The Bayesian meta-regression tool DisMod-MR 2.1 was used to model overall morbidity due to LRIs. DALYs were calculated as the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs) for all locations, years, age groups, and sexes. We modelled pathogen-specific case-fatality ratios (CFRs) for each age group and location using splined binomial regression to create internally consistent estimates of incidence and mortality proportions attributable to viral, fungal, parasitic, and bacterial pathogens. Progress was assessed towards the GAPPD target of less than three deaths from pneumonia per 1000 livebirths, which is roughly equivalent to a mortality rate of less than 60 deaths per 100 000 children younger than 5 years. In 2023, LRIs were responsible for 2·50 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 2·24-2·81) deaths and 98·7 million (87·7-112) DALYs, with children younger than 5 years and adults aged 70 years and older carrying the highest burden. LRI mortality in children younger than 5 years fell by 33·4% (10·4-47·4) since 2010, with a global mortality rate of 94·8 (75·6-116·4) per 100 000 person-years in 2023. Among adults aged 70 years and older, the burden remained substantial with only marginal declines since 2010. A mortality rate of less than 60 deaths per 100 000 for children younger than 5 years was met by 129 of the 204 modelled countries in 2023. At a super-regional level, sub-Saharan Africa had an aggregate mortality rate in children younger than 5 years (hereafter referred to as under-5 mortality rate) furthest from the GAPPD target. Streptococcus pneumoniae continued to account for the largest number of LRI deaths globally (634 000 [95% UI 565 000-721 000] deaths or 25·3% [24·5-26·1] of all LRI deaths), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (271 000 [243 000-298 000] deaths or 10·9% [10·3-11·3]), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (228 000 [204 000-261 000] deaths or 9·1% [8·8-9·5]). Among pathogens newly modelled in this study, non-tuberculous mycobacteria (responsible for 177 000 [95% UI 155 000-201 000] deaths) and Aspergillus spp (responsible for 67 800 [59 900-75 900] deaths) emerged as important contributors. Altogether, the 11 newly modelled pathogens accounted for approximately 22% of LRI deaths. This comprehensive analysis underscores both the gains achieved through vaccination and the challenges that remain in controlling the LRI burden globally. Furthermore, it demonstrates persistent disparities in disease burden, with the highest mortality rates concentrated in countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Globally, as well as in these high-burden locations, the under-5 LRI mortality rate remains well above the GAPPD target. Progress towards this target requires equitable access to vaccines and preventive therapies-including newer interventions such as respiratory syncytial virus monoclonal antibodies-and health systems capable of early diagnosis and treatment. Expanding surveillance of emerging pathogens, strengthening adult immunisation programmes, and combating vaccine hesitancy are also crucial. As the global population ages, the dual challenge of sustaining gains in child survival while addressing the rising vulnerability in older adults will shape future pneumonia control strategies.

Characterization of indoor particulate matter by home heating fuel type in rural New Hampshire homes.,"Over six million Americans rely on solid fuels for residential heating, which can result in high concentrations of fine and ultrafine particulate matter (PM). Little is known on the characteristics of indoor PM in rural homes, including lung deposited surface area (LDSA) concentration and metals composition, and whether these characteristics may vary by fuel type. Homes using oil, cordwood, or pellet were recruited into the study. Indoor air quality assessment over 48 hours included PM Ten homes completed the study- three used primary oil-fueled furnaces/boilers, four used primarily cordwood, and three used pellet fuel. Activity logs and real time measurements highlighted elevated indoor pollution events such as loading wood stoves and cooking. Maximum indoor air particle number concentrations measured were similar across fuel types, though total average particle concentrations, maximum mass, and LDSA concentrations were highly variable. For individual elements Ca, K, Cu, Cd, and Pb, there was a trend of higher concentrations in cordwood heated home, followed by pellet, and then oil heat. Exposure characteristics and elemental composition of fine and ultrafine particles in rural homes vary by heating fuel type. Due to the contributions from other indoor activities to ultrafine PM, we suggest trace elements might be a better marker of woodsmoke exposure compared to other particle metrics."
EAACI Guidelines on the Importance of Green Space in Urban Environments for Allergy and Asthma Prevention.,"The allergy and asthma epidemic in urban societies following World War II is mostly caused by changes in the environment, diet and lifestyle. Disconnection of urban populations from the wider environment has reduced the protective factors building up immunological resilience. The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) guidelines on greenness impact on allergy and asthma follow the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach and provide eight recommendations encouraging greenness exposure to support immune health. Controlled follow-up studies are still scarce, and the strength of evidence is generally low or moderate at best. For primary prevention of allergy and asthma, most of the evidence indicates beneficial effects. Exposure is also useful for secondary prevention. Asthma patients may feel better and need less medication by combining green space exposure with physical activity. During the high-pollen season, effective seasonal medication is necessary for patients with pollen allergy. In urban planning, implementing appropriate green infrastructure and easy access to green space promotes immune health and reduces risks of air pollution and heatwaves. These EAACI guidelines are the first recommendations highlighting the importance of urban green spaces on immune health and call for prioritising innovative research in this field."
Impact of air pollution and population vulnerability on cancer mortality in the United States: A scoping review.,"Ambient air pollution is an important contributor to cancer risk. While previous studies have examined the impact of air pollution on cancer mortality, they have largely overlooked how population vulnerability indicators, such as socioeconomic status, interact with air pollution to influence cancer mortality across cancer types. This review aimed to address this gap by systematically reviewing these effect modifications and providing insights to inform efforts aimed at reducing differential health burdens. We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies conducted in the U.S. published between January 1, 1994, and January 27, 2024. Covidence was used to manage study selection and data extraction, including study design, air pollutants, population vulnerability indicators (e.g., urbanicity, proximity to pollution, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity), exposure assessment methods, cancer types, and findings. We identified 15 articles and found that the associations between air pollution and cancer mortality varied by urbanicity and socioeconomic status. A slight majority of studies reported stronger associations in less urbanized populations and lower-SES groups. Black individuals experienced higher cancer mortality risks from air pollution than Whites, while findings for Hispanics and Asians were inconsistent. Air pollution exposure and population vulnerability indicators jointly contribute to disparities in cancer mortality, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations such as those in less urbanized areas and marginalized racial and ethnic groups. Targeted research and policies are needed to mitigate these inequities, improve air quality, and reduce cancer mortality in high-risk communities."
"Global burden of tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer attributable to second-hand smoke exposure from 1992 to 2021: an age-period-cohort analysis and 25-year mortality projections.","Tracheal, bronchus, and lung (TBL) cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. While smoking is the primary risk factor, several non-smoking-related factors also significantly contribute to TBL cancer, notably second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure, which plays a substantial role in the disease's burden. This study assesses and forecasts the temporal trends in the disease burden of TBL cancer attributable to SHS exposure at global, regional, and national levels. We extracted data from the ≥ 25 years population in the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 (GBD 2021) to assess deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR), and age-standardized DALY rate (ASDR) at both global and regional levels. We evaluated temporal trends using descriptive statistics, estimated annual percentage change (EAPC), and both the age-period-cohort (APC) and Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) models. From 1992 to 2021, absolute deaths and DALYs linked to TBL cancer due to SHS exposure increased, although ASMR and ASDR showed declining trends, with EAPC values of -0.92% and -1.30%, respectively. Regions with a high socio-demographic index (SDI) displayed the most significant improvements. In contrast, high-middle and middle SDI regions bore the greatest disease burden, and low SDI regions saw minimal progress. The highest ASMR in 2021 occurred mainly in Western Europe, North America, and East Asia, with ASMR correlating positively with SDI. The disease burden was consistently higher among males, particularly in the 65-74 age group, across both sexes. Future projections indicate a continuing decline in the disease burden from 2022 to 2046. SHS exposure continues to be a significant factor in the disease burden of TBL cancer. Although there has been an overall declining trend globally, it still caused the deaths of more than 97,000 people in 2021. There exists considerable heterogeneity among regions, with some areas still bearing a substantial disease burden. These findings highlight the need for specific prevention and control strategies to mitigate the health impacts of SHS exposure."
"Global trends in the burden of tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer attributable to household air pollution.","Tracheal, bronchial, and lung (TBL) cancers, largely attributable to household air pollution (HAP), remain a critical public health challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021, this study evaluates global trends in HAP-related TBL cancer burden from 1990 to 2021 and projects future trends to 2051. The study extracted data on deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from the GBD 2021 and assessed the burden of TBL cancer attributable to HAP by sex, age, region, and socio-demographic index (SDI). The age-period-cohort (APC) model examined the independent effects of age, period, and cohort, while the Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) model predicted future trends over the next 30 years. Between 1990 and 2021, deaths and DALYs from TBL cancer due to HAP decreased by 39.2% and 44.1%, respectively, with the largest declines in high SDI regions, while rates increased in Oceania and sub-Saharan Africa. The global age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) peaked in the 85-89 years age group, and the age-standardized disability rate (ASDR) peaked in the 70-74 years age group. Males experienced a higher burden than females, with significant differences observed across SDI regions. Projections suggest that mortality and DALYs rates will rise over the next 30 years, with a higher burden forecast for females. Despite significant reductions, TBL cancer from HAP remains a major issue in low SDI regions, particularly in China. Projections indicate increasing mortality and DALYs rates over the next 30 years, disproportionately affecting women, highlighting the urgent need for targeted policies to reduce HAP exposure."
Examining the Interaction between Allergic Asthma and Air Pollution: a Potential Role for Trained Immunity.,"Asthma represents a major global health burden, with incidence increasing substantially over the past 50 years. Epidemiologic studies have linked this rise in asthma to escalating air pollution; however, the biological mechanisms remain undefined. Recent evidence has highlighted a role for innate immune memory, or trained immunity, in asthma pathogenesis; however, the contribution of air pollution remains unclear. This review synthesizes emerging findings on how air pollution shapes trained immunity in asthma and related inflammatory lung diseases. Air pollutants increase gene acetylation and methylation and disrupt innate immune cell metabolism. These immune mediated changes are consistent with features of trained immunity, a process that remains largely underexplored. Collectively, these data support the concept that air pollution imprints long-lasting epigenomic and immunometabolic changes on innate immune cells, thereby contributing to asthma susceptibility and severity. Future studies will focus on mechanistic investigations to further elucidate how pollutants dysregulate innate immune memory."

"Air pollution exposure modes, smoking and genetic risk with chronic respiratory diseases: a prospective study.","Previous studies often focused on single pollutant source, failing to replicate real-world exposure scenarios for chronic respiratory disease (CRD) risk. We aimed to explore the mixed exposure patterns of CRD risk factors and investigate interactions with smoking and genetic risk. We identified air pollution exposure modes using latent class analysis (LCA) in the UK Biobank. Cox model assessed associations between exposure modes and lung cancer (LC), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Interactions among exposure modes, smoking and genetic risk were analyzed. LCA divided participants into five groups, and hazard ratios (HRs) for ""High air pollution"" group were 1.28 for LC (95% CI: 1.08-1.52), 1.23 for IPF (95% CI: 1.03-1.48), 1.28 for COPD (95% CI: 1.17-1.39) and 1.09 for asthma (95% CI: 1.01-1.18). Significant additive interactions between high air pollution and smoking were observed for LC and COPD. Individuals with high genetic risk exposed to both smoking and high air pollution showed the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) of 2.74 for LC, 3.93 for IPF, and 1.68 for COPD. Smoking and air pollution together accounted for over 40% of LC, IPF and COPD cases. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between environmental air pollution, smoking, and genetic risk in CRD development in real-world exposure scenarios."

"Quantifying the fatal and non-fatal burden of disease associated with child growth failure, 2000-2023: a systematic analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023.","Child growth failure (CGF), which includes underweight, wasting, and stunting, is among the factors most strongly associated with mortality and morbidity in children younger than 5 years worldwide. Poor height and bodyweight gain arise from a variety of biological and sociodemographic factors and are associated with increased vulnerability to infectious diseases. We used data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2023 to estimate CGF prevalence, the risk of infectious diseases associated with CGF, and the disease mortality, morbidity, and overall burden associated with CGF. In this analysis we estimated the all-cause and cause-specific (diarrhoea, lower respiratory tract infections, malaria, and measles) disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost and mortality associated with stunting, wasting, underweight, and CGF in aggregate. We combined the burden associated with mild, moderate, and severe forms of CGF: stunting was defined as height-for-age Z scores (HAZ) less than -1, underweight was defined as weight-for-age Z scores (WAZ) less than -1, and wasting was defined as weight-for-height Z scores (WHZ) less than -1, according to WHO Child Growth Standards. Population-level continuous distributions of HAZ, WAZ, and WHZ were estimated for 2000 to 2023 using data from surveys, literature, and individual-level study data. The risk of incidence of, and mortality due to, diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, malaria, and measles was separately estimated in a meta-regression framework from longitudinal cohort data for Z scores less than -1. Finally, fatal outcomes associated with these diseases were estimated with vital registration, verbal autopsy, and case-fatality data, while non-fatal outcomes were estimated with surveys as well as health-care utilisation and case reporting data. The exposure prevalence and relative risk estimates were from continuous distributions, allowing for direct assessment of the attributable fractions for mild, moderate, and severe stunting, underweight, wasting, and the combined impact of child growth failure within populations. All estimates were age-specific, sex-specific, geography-specific, and year-specific. We estimated that, in children younger than 5 years in 2023, CGF was associated with 79·4 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 47·0-106) DALYs lost and 880 000 (517 000-1 170 000) deaths. This represented 17·9% (10·6-23·8) of 444 million (434-457) total under-5 DALYs and 18·8% (11·1-25·0) of all 4·67 million (4·59-4·75) under-5 deaths. Compared to stunting (33·0 million [24·1-42·2] DALYs, 373 000 [272 000-477 000] deaths) and wasting (39·2 million [23·8-53·0] DALYs, 428 000 [256 000-583 000] deaths), childhood underweight was associated with the largest share of CGF-related disease burden: 52·2 million (21·9-75·1) DALYs and 573 000 (236 000-824 000) deaths in children younger than 5 years in 2023. CGF remains a leading factor associated with death and disability in children younger than 5 years, despite global attention and focused interventions to reduce the prevalence of associated CGF indicators. Our findings underscore the need for policies, strategies, and interventions that focus on all indicators of CGF to reduce its associated health burden. Gates Foundation."
Multi-organ toxicity of ultrafine particles derived from air pollution: a sub-chronic exposure study in mice.,"Although air pollution-derived ultrafine particles (UFP) can reach extrapulmonary organs, current understanding of their distribution and toxicodynamics remains scarce and largely focused on the lung. In this work, we conducted, to the best of our knowledge, the first in vivo study using a multi-organ approach to assess both the toxicokinetics (i.e., biodistribution) and the toxicodynamics (i.e., oxidative stress, inflammation) of air pollution-derived UFP collected in an urban environment in mice sub-chronically exposed. The intrinsic oxidative potential (OP) of UFP was assessed prior to sub-chronic exposure of Balb/cJRj mice to 0, 10, or 30 μg of UFP/40 μL of sterile saline for 3 months. In the lungs, the heart, the liver, the kidneys, and the brain, oxidative stress was assessed by Nrf2 antioxidant cell signaling pathway activation, glutathione status, and oxidative damage, while NFкB-mediated inflammation was evaluated by specific cytokine secretion. UFP predominantly accumulate in the lung; however, these particles, together with their inorganic and/or organic components, can translocate into the bloodstream and reach highly vascularized extrapulmonary organs (i.e., heart, liver, kidneys, and brain). Owing to their high OP, UFP activated the Nrf2 antioxidant cell signaling pathway and the glutathione scavenging system, contributing to redox homeostasis in all the examined organs, particularly the lung and the brain, without inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine secretion. Taken together, these results highlighted the importance of considering both the biodistribution and the adverse health effects of UFP not only in the lung but also in extrapulmonary organs when assessing health risks."
Can the risk of lung cancer mortality be predicted by the sex ratio at birth?,"Over the past 5 decades, sex ratio at birth (SRB) has declined significantly. It is noteworthy that SRBs may vary considerably across geographical regions and time periods, making them a valuable indicator of general population health and a potential signal of adverse environmental conditions.

The burden of chronic respiratory disease in Western Pacific Region from 1990 to 2021: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021.,"Chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumoconiosis, interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary sarcoidosis pose a major global health challenge. This study thoroughly examines the impact of CRDs in the Western Pacific Region (WPR) from 1990 to 2021. Using data from the Global Burden of Disease 2021 study, we evaluated the CRD burden (incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in the WPR. The analysis was categorized by age (20-54, ≥ 55), sex, country, CRD subtype, and risk factors, with temporal trends measured by annual and average annual percentage changes (APC, AAPC). From 1990 to 2021, CRD-related DALYs and mortality decreased across all ages, but incidence and prevalence have increased in those aged 20-54 since 2014. Men bear a higher CRD burden than women, though the gap is closing in the 20-54 age group. Air pollution and tobacco are key risk factors, with high body mass index (BMI) becoming more significant, especially for ages 20-54. High-socio-demographic index (SDI) countries show lower mortality and DALYs despite high prevalence and incidence. COPD and asthma are the main CRDs, with asthma most common in ages 20-54 and COPD in those 55 and older. ILD and pulmonary sarcoidosis burdens have risen, particularly in the 55 + group and in medium-high SDI countries like Japan, Australia, and South Korea. Pneumoconiosis is most prevalent in China and South Korea, mainly affecting males aged 20-54. Despite advances in lowering CRD mortality and DALYs in the Western Pacific since 1990, challenges persist, including high COPD and asthma rates, rising ILD and pulmonary sarcoidosis, localized pneumoconiosis, and more young adult cases. Ongoing efforts in tobacco control, air pollution reduction, weight management, and occupational safety are crucial to further decrease the CRD burden."

Accounting for Mobility in Air Pollution Exposure Estimates in Studies on Long-Term Health Effects.,"Large-scale epidemiological studies investigating long-term health effects of air pollution can typically only consider the residential locations of the participants, thereby ignoring the space-time-activity patterns that likely influence total exposure. People are mobile and can be exposed to considerably different levels of air pollution or air pollution mixtures when inside versus outside, commuting, recreating, or working. Neglecting these mechanisms in exposure assessment may lead to incorrect distributions of exposure over the population, which may, subsequently, lead to incorrect exposure-health relations in epidemiological studies. In this study, we investigated whether a more sophisticated mobility-enhanced exposure assessment would lead to different exposure predictions and health effect estimates compared with using a residential-based exposure. Agent-based modeling (ABM We successfully developed mobility-enhanced exposures for over 3 million participants, including an assessment of uncertainty. We found a good agreement between exposures estimated with the app and the GPS tracker, supporting the scalability of the approach. We evaluated the ABMs with GPS and time-activity data collected independently in tracking campaigns that included almost 700 participants from selected areas in the two countries. For these participants, the exposures based on GPS measurements versus those derived from ABM showed a moderate to good agreement (R Our results suggest that the assessment of air pollution exposure at the residential address in epidemiological studies generally does not lead to substantial bias in health effects estimates. If time-activity patterns in other study areas differ greatly from the patterns analyzed in our study, differences between residential and activity-enhanced exposures may be larger. Despite the good agreement between residential and work locations, exposure research should continue to strive toward improving exposure assessment in large-scale epidemiological studies to minimize exposure misclassification."
[PM2.5-induced M2 Polarization and IL-1α Secretion by Tumor-associated Macrophages Promotes Lung Adenocarcinoma Progression].,"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains one of the leading causes of cancer morbidity and mortality worldwide, and its initiation and progression are closely associated with the tumor immune microenvironment. Increasing evidence suggests that environmental exposure is a critical factor influencing lung cancer development. Among these factors, fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a major component of air pollution, has been strongly linked to elevated lung cancer risk and unfavorable prognosis. However, the underlying immunoregulatory mechanisms by which PM2.5 drives LUAD progression remain poorly understood. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), especially those polarized toward the M2 phenotype, are key components of the tumor microenvironment and play crucial roles in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and immune evasion. This study aims to investigate the effects of PM2.5 exposure on TAMs and to identify the key pro-tumorigenic factors mediating this process. A mouse orthotopic lung cancer model under PM2.5 exposure was established to assess lung tumor growth and macrophage phenotypic alterations using in vivo imaging and flow cytometry. A subcutaneous tumor model involving co-inoculated macrophages and tumor cells was used to further verify the effects of PM2.5 on the function of TAMs and tumor malignancy. Combining in vitro experiments, flow cytometry, Western blot, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation assay, and wound healing assay were employed to evaluate the regulatory effects of PM2.5 on the polarization of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) as well as tumor cell proliferation, migration, and colony-forming ability. Transcriptome sequencing integrated with TISIDB (Tumor-immune System Interactions Database) and GEPIA (Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis) databases was performed to identify key cytokines for further functional validation. In the mouse orthotopic lung cancer model, PM2.5 exposure significantly promoted tumor growth and increased the proportion of M2-type TAMs (P<0.05). Subcutaneous co-inoculation with PM2.5-treated BMDMs markedly enhanced tumor proliferation and elevated the intratumoral M2-type TAMs. PM2.5-pretreated BMDMs exhibited an immunosuppressive programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)+/arginase 1 (Arg1)+ phenotype, and their conditioned media significantly promoted proliferation, migration, and colony formation of Lewis lung carcinoma cells (LLC) and B16 melanoma cells (B16) (P<0.05). Transcriptome analysis revealed that PM2.5 substantially altered macrophage gene expression, with IL-1α identified as a key upregulated secreted cytokine enriched in immunosuppressive related signaling pathways. Clinical database analyses further indicated that IL-1α expression was positively correlated with macrophage and regulatory T cells (Treg) infiltration in the LUAD immune microenvironment, and that high IL-1α expression was associated with worse overall survival in LUAD patients (HR=1.5, P=0.0053). Western blot, RT-qPCR, and immunofluorescence confirmed that PM2.5 exposure significantly upregulated IL-1α expression and secretion in TAMs. PM2.5 exposure facilitates LUAD progression by inducing an immunosuppressive phenotype in macrophages and enhancing the malignant behaviors of tumor cells. Mechanistically, IL-1α may serve as a key pro-tumorigenic cytokine secreted by macrophages under PM2.5 exposure. This study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of PM2.5-associated LUAD and suggests that IL-1α could serve as a potential therapeutic target. 【中文题目：PM2.5暴露通过诱导肿瘤相关巨噬细胞M2极化及IL-1α的分泌促进肺腺癌进展的机制研究】 【中文摘要：背景与目的 肺腺癌（lung adenocarcinoma, LUAD）是全球发病率和死亡率均居前列的恶性肿瘤，其发生发展与肿瘤免疫微环境密切相关。近年来，大量研究表明，环境暴露因素在LUAD发生中具有重要作用，其中细颗粒物（PM2.5）作为空气污染的主要成分之一，已被证实与肺癌发病风险增加及预后不良密切相关。然而，PM2.5如何通过调控肿瘤免疫微环境促进LUAD进展的分子机制尚不清楚。肿瘤相关巨噬细胞（tumor-associated macrophages, TAMs），尤其是M2型巨噬细胞，在肿瘤生长、血管生成及免疫逃逸中起关键作用。本研究旨在探讨PM2.5暴露是否通过重塑TAMs功能促进LUAD进展，并筛选关键促癌因子。方法 本研究首先构建PM2.5暴露的小鼠原位肺癌模型，采用活体成像技术和流式细胞术分析肺部肿瘤生长及巨噬细胞表型变化。其次，通过巨噬细胞与肿瘤细胞共接种构建皮下移植瘤模型，进一步验证PM2.5对TAMs功能及肿瘤恶性行为的影响。结合体外细胞实验，运用流式细胞术、Western blot、逆转录定量聚合酶链反应（reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, RT-qPCR）、细胞增殖试验（cell counting kit-8, CCK-8）、克隆形成及划痕实验，评估PM2.5对骨髓来源巨噬细胞（bone marrow-derived macrophage, BMDMs）表型及肿瘤细胞增殖、迁移与克隆形成能力的调控作用。最后，通过转录组测序并结合TISIDB（Tumor-immune System Interactions Database）、GEPIA（Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis）等公共数据库进行生物信息学分析，筛选关键细胞因子并进行功能验证。结果 小鼠原位肺癌模型显示，PM2.5暴露可显著促进肺癌生长，并增加M2型TAMs比例（P<0.05）。皮下移植瘤模型显示，共接种PM2.5处理的BMDMs可明显促进肿瘤细胞增殖，且瘤内M2型TAMs比例上调。PM2.5预处理的BMDMs呈现程序性细胞死亡配体1（programmed cell death ligand 1, PD-L1）+、精氨酸酶1（arginase 1, ARG1）+免疫抑制表型，其条件培养基显著增强Lewis肺癌细胞（Lewis lung carcinoma, LLC）和黑色素瘤细胞（B16 melanoma cells, B16）迁移与克隆形成能力（P<0.05）。转录组测序结果显示，PM2.5处理显著改变巨噬细胞基因表达谱，其中白细胞介素-1α（interleukin-1α, IL-1α）作为关键上调的分泌因子，富集于免疫抑制相关信号通路。临床数据库分析进一步表明，IL-1α表达水平与LUAD免疫微环境中巨噬细胞及调节性T淋巴细胞（regulatory T cells, Treg）浸润程度呈正相关，且IL-1α高表达与LUAD患者较差的总生存期显著关联（HR=1.5, P=0.0053）。Western blot、RT-qPCR及免疫荧光实验证实，PM2.5暴露可显著上调TAMs中IL-1α的表达并促进其分泌。结论 PM2.5暴露通过诱导巨噬细胞获得免疫抑制表型并增强肿瘤细胞恶性行为，从而促进LUAD进展。机制上，IL-1α可能是PM2.5暴露环境下巨噬细胞分泌的关键促癌因子。本研究为PM2.5相关LUAD的发病机制提供了新见解，并提示IL-1α可能成为潜在治疗靶点。 】 【中文关键词：肺肿瘤；PM2.5；肿瘤相关巨噬细胞；IL-1α；肿瘤微环境】."

Global impact of air pollution on cancer: causal evidence and health inequities across regions from 1990 to 2021.,"This study explored the correlation and causation between air pollutants and cancer at both the macro level, using Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data, and the genetic level, based on Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) data. This study investigated the impact of air pollution on cancer burden at global, regional, and national levels, analyzing variations across age groups and genders and exploring its association with the socio-demographic index (SDI). An ARIMA model was applied to predict the future prevalence of air pollution-related cancers through 2050. Additionally, the study examined the causal relationship between specific air pollutants and 17 types of cancer by conducting two-sample MR analyses, utilizing GWAS data from the UK Biobank and FinnGen databases to assess genetic susceptibility. In 2021, air pollution contributed to approximately 0.37 million cancer-related deaths and 8.93 million DALYs, reflecting a declining trend in this0 health burden before 2020, followed by a slight increase in 2021. The highest burden was observed among individuals aged 75-90, with males being more affected. Projections indicate a likely decline in disease prevalence in high-SDI regions, while countries such as China and parts of Africa may face greater challenges by 2030 and 2050. Mendelian randomization analyses identified significant associations of PM₂.₅, NO₂, and NOx with bronchial and lung cancers and of NO₂ with stomach cancer, validated in both discovery and replication datasets, with the NO₂ association with gastric cancer remaining significant after adjustment for smoking. The GBD study revealed the macro-level impact of air pollution on cancer, with MR analysis confirming its genetic link. These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted policies and interventions to control air pollution and reduce the cancer burden."
Identifying high-risk workplaces for radon: The role of buildings' foundations and underground water sources.,"Radon, a naturally occurring lung carcinogen, can seep into buildings and expose occupants, including workers. Our aim is to describe radon exposure in various workplaces, identify factors associated with exposure, and highlight levers for preventive action. Workplaces with an underground or slab-on-grade work area were recruited in four regions of Québec (Central Canada) with high and low potential for radon emissions. Long-term radon samples were taken during the cold season with Alpha Track AT-100 passive dosimeters, deployed by the research team in accordance with Health Canada's Guide for radon measurements in public buildings. There were 354 radon measurements in 57 buildings constructed between 1877 and 2021 (54 workplaces), with on average six measurements (1-28) per workplace during a median of 109 days. Ten buildings had all measurements below the detection limit (15 Bq/m³), and six had at least one measurement above 100 Bq/m³. The highest values recorded were in a fish hatchery (>1500 Bq/m³). Generalized estimating equations revealed that a lowest floor made of materials other than poured concrete, the presence of naturally occurring radioactive material (underground water), and a small building footprint were the most predictive factors of higher concentrations, regardless of the regional radon emission potential. In this convenience sample, most workplaces presented radon concentrations well below guidelines. However, the surprise expressed by workplace managers and public health officials regarding high concentrations associated with NORM is evidence of a lack of awareness of the dangers of radon in these environments."
Surfactant Protein D Mediates the Association Between Smoking and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Incidence in the Spanish Adult Population: Di@bet.es Study.,"It is well known that environmental factors influence the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Several studies have linked the xenobiotics present in tobacco or air pollutants to T2DM development, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Surfactant protein D (SP-D), an immune component released into the bloodstream after lung injury, has been associated with metabolic diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate whether SP-D mediates the effects of smoking or air pollution exposure on T2DM risk in the Spanish adult population. Socio-demographic, lifestyle (including smoking status) and clinical data from 2155 participants from the Di@bet.es cohort were analyzed. Annual concentrations of PM"
"Addressing the Most Critical Challenges in COPD: An Expert Review of Emotional, Economic, and Evidence-Based Perspectives.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive, non-communicable respiratory disease characterized by frequent symptoms, including dyspnea, cough, and sputum production. It affects approximately 10.6% of the global population. It is the third cause of death worldwide and it is projected to impact 592 million globally by 2050. Risk factors, including smoking, air pollution, genetics and infections, can influence disease progression and impact patients' daily lives, causing symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue and cough, along with other comorbidities, such as cardiovascular diseases or anxiety. Additionally, COPD imposes a significant economic burden on the health system and patients themselves. Despite being a preventable and treatable disease, the patient journey is marked by multiple challenges, including emotional, economic, and evidence-based barriers that delay diagnosis, hinder treatment and worsen the disease's impact, due to misconceptions, stigma, limited access to diagnostic resources, and inconsistent treatment practices. In this expert review, we propose a framework for discussion about COPD from an emotional, economic and evidence-based perspective, and recommend calls to action to address these challenges, with the aim of reducing the global economic, patient and social burden of COPD. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive, non-communicable respiratory disease associated with symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and sputum production, which has a significant impact on patients’ quality of life. Currently, it is the third leading cause of death globally and it affects approximately 10.6% of the global population. Despite its severity, COPD is not a priority for healthcare systems and is less prioritized compared to other chronic diseases. For this review, we examined existing literature and data on COPD impact on patients and healthcare systems to identify challenges in diagnosis, treatment, and long-term monitoring and propose calls to action to make COPD a priority for policymakers. With this aim, we proposed a framework to describe challenges from an emotional, economic, and evidence-based perspective and propose calls to action addressing the most critical challenges of COPD along the patient journey, such as raising awareness, improving diagnostic practices, and ensuring access to effective treatments. We encourage policymakers to increase public health education, enhance healthcare provider training, and strengthen advocacy efforts to achieve earlier diagnosis, better treatment adherence, and improved quality of life for people with COPD."
Exposure to diesel particulates induces an immunosuppressive microenvironment that promotes the progression of lung cancer.,"A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms by which air pollutant exposure drives cancer progression remains incomplete. Particulate matter has been shown to induce genotoxicity and mutagenesis through oxidative stress both in vivo and in vitro. However, its impact on the pulmonary immune microenvironment and its role in modulating anti-tumour immune responses remains poorly characterized. Here, we report that chronic exposure to diesel exhaust particles (DEPs), a major component of PM2.5, induces an immunosuppressive lung microenvironment that promotes tumour progression in a KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma model (Kras"
New insights into lung cancer risks in middle-aged and older Chinese adults: A CHARLS prospective cohort study with multi-source external validation.,"Lung cancer represents a significant public health burden in China; however, prospective studies on nationally representative risk factors are limited. This study identifies novel risk factors for lung cancer in middle-aged and older Chinese adults using prospective cohort data, with validation through multi-source methods. The study analyzed 14,964 cancer-free participants from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS, 2011-2018). Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate demographic, lifestyle, comorbidity, and environmental factors. External validation included the NHANES cohort (n = 20,278), bibliometric analysis (21,820 papers), and single-center hospital data (200 cases/200 controls). Key risk factors identified include urban residence (HR = 2.71, p = 0.014), diabetes (HR = 2.84, 95 % CI: 1.06-7.63), smoking behavior (each year of delayed smoking cessation increases risk by 4.8 %, each additional cigarette daily raises risk by 4.0 %), and biomass cooking fuel (HR = 5.98, p = 0.083). External validation confirmed the smoking metrics; however, the diabetes-lung cancer association was absent in the NHANES cohort. PM2.5 was also validated as a significant risk factor. Urban residence, diabetes, and smoking behaviors (cessation age/daily quantity) are identified as novel lung cancer risk factors in Chinese adults. The study supports tailored interventions focusing on air quality, metabolic management, and personalized smoking cessation programs, with individualized smoking assessments rather than a simple ""smoker/non-smoker"" classification."
The gut-lung axis: a new perspective on the impact of atmospheric particulate matter exposure on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Environmental pollution is a serious public health problem closely related to various chronic respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchial asthma, and lung malignancies. Atmospheric particulate matter (PM) is an important component of environmental pollution, and its influence on COPD has been shown to be related to inflammation, oxidative stress, immune imbalance, abnormal cell death, and cell aging. A growing body of evidence has shown that an imbalance of the lung and intestinal microbiota, as well as changes in metabolites, is closely related to the occurrence and development of PM-induced COPD. PM exposure damages the respiratory system and alters the structure and activity of the gut microbiome. The metabolites produced by the gut microbiome, in turn, disrupt airway immunity and exacerbate respiratory inflammation. Therefore, the bidirectional influence of PM on the gut-lung axis has attracted widespread attention. This review explores the mechanisms by which PM causes oxidative stress damage to the lungs and intestines, as well as the characteristics of the resultant immune imbalance and changes in the microbiota and metabolite products. It also describes how PM disrupts barrier function through microecological imbalance and how it participates in the progression of COPD via the gut-lung axis. These mechanisms highlight the potential of targeting the microbial flora as a new approach for treating COPD caused by environmental pollution."
Air pollution and dynamic transitions of preserved ratio impaired spirometry in UK Biobank.,"Although air pollution has been recognized as a risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), little is known regarding the role of air pollutant exposure, specifically particulate matter (PM), in the dynamic transitions among normal spirometry (lung function), pre-COPD status, and COPD status. Pulmonary function observations from the UK Biobank cohort were categorized as normal spirometry, preserved ratio impaired spirometry (PRISm), defined as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV We include 33,217 participants (71,287 visits) and find that each interquartile range increase in exposure of PM Findings reveal that higher levels of PM Mild impairment in lung function, known as PRISm, can either progress to chronic lung disease such as COPD or return to normal. While air pollution is known to harm lung health, its impact on the transitional direction of the PRISm stage remains unclear. We studied more than 33,000 adults in the UK Biobank who had repeated lung function tests. We found that people exposed to higher levels of fine particles (PM"
"The global burden, trends and cross-region inequities of non-communicable diseases attributed to ambient particulate matter pollution.","Ambient particulate matter poses long-term and geographically uneven health risks, warranting assessment of global burden and regional disparities. GBD 2019 data was used to assess age standardized rates of mortality (ASMR) and DALY (ASDR) from five chronic diseases due to ambient particulate matter from 1990 to 2019, focusing on temporal trends and cross-regional disparities using the Socio-demographic Index (SDI). In 2019, ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke accounted for the greatest burdens attributable to ambient particulate matter, with global ASMRs of 30 and 26 per 100,000, respectively, followed by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at 16, tracheal bronchus and lung (TBL) cancer at 6.8, and diabetes mellitus at 4.5. From 1990 to 2019, COPD showed a marked decline with an AAPC on ASMR of -0.47, while diabetes and TBL cancer rose sharply, with AAPCs of 1.57 and 0.75, respectively. ASDR for the five disease had similar patterns. Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania carried the heaviest TBL cancer and stroke burden from 2000 on, North Africa and the Middle East ranked consistently highest for IHD and diabetes mellitus, and South Asia emerged as the global hotspot for COPD after 2005. TBL cancer was concentrated in higher-SDI regions, whereas COPD and diabetes mellitus rose disproportionately in lower-SDI areas. Population growth and aging were the primary drivers of increases across all diseases. Health inequality analysis further showed a general shift of burdens from high- to low-SDI countries, with indices declining from high positive values to lower or even negative values between 1990 and 2019. Ambient particulate matter continues to drive unequal disease burdens, especially in low- and middle-SDI regions, and more targeted efforts are thus needed."

"Reducing lung cancer risk from radon exposure in Manheim Township, PA: Radon Resistant New Construction (RRNC) as a significant public health tool.","Radon is a known human carcinogen and the second leading cause of lung cancer worldwide. This study evaluated the effectiveness of Radon Resistant New Construction (RRNC) ordinances enacted in Manheim Township, Pennsylvania, which mandate RRNC features in all new dwellings, to reduce lung cancer risk associated with radon exposure. We identified new dwellings in Manheim Township built under RRNC ordinances and analyzed corresponding radon test and mitigation data from PA DEP databases. After carefully reviewing the data and correcting database reporting anomalies, we evaluated indoor radon levels with and without RRNC and estimated the average reduction. Finally, we employed an existing dose-response model to estimate the average reduction of lung cancer risk associated with RRNC, taking smoking status into consideration. We analyzed 1,734 radon tests conducted in 483 homes, and found on average those homes built with RRNC features reduced the indoor radon concentration by 16.71 pCi/L and lowered the excess relative lung cancer risk attributable to radon exposure by 99%, regardless of smoking status. Using real world data collected both before and after a change in municipal laws, these results provide strong evidence supporting the adoption of similar mandatory RRNC in other PA jurisdictions, nationwide, and in other countries that seek to reduce radon exposure and associated risks in indoor environment. This study demonstrates that the adoption and implementation of RRNC can reduce indoor radon levels, and consequently lower radon-related lung cancer risks."
A spatial lag model analysis of lung cancer incidence and satellite-derived data on air pollution in Thailand from 2020 to 2023.,"This study aimed at investigating the association between satellite-based remotely sensed data on particulate matter with diameters less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) on the one hand, with the incidence of lung cancer in Thailand on the other. Regression analyses on a nationwide dataset comprising 604,460 confirmed cases reported between 2020 and 2023 were conducted using the Spatial Lag Model (SLM) to assess the relationship between the ambient air pollutants and lung cancer incidence. The results revealed that provinces with the highest cancer incidence rates were consistently found to be located in the eastern part of north-eastern Thailand and the far North as well as some provinces in the South. The SLM accounted for a moderate proportion of variance in lung cancer incidence, with R² values ranging from 0.1548 to 0.1755 over the study period. PM2.5 concentrations were positively and significantly associated with incidence rates each year, an effect increasing from 2020 (0.2160, p=0.0075) to 2023 (0.3096, p=0.0102). These findings highlight the potential of satellite-based air quality data, particularly PM2.5 for predicting and monitoring lung cancer incidence, thereby supporting evidence- based public health planning and environmental policy in Thailand. The results add empirical evidence to the growing body of literature demonstrating the public health consequences of ambient air pollution."
Marginal structural models for quantifying the causal effects of exposure to ambient air pollution on progression of CT emphysema in the MESA Lung and MESA Air Studies.,"Associations between exposure to ambient air pollution and progression of emphysema have been identified in longitudinal observational studies. However, previous work has not used statistical causal inference methods tailored to address bias from time-varying confounding. The objective of this study is to propose an analytical approach for estimating longitudinal health effects of air pollution while accounting for time-varying confounding using marginal structural models and to re-analyze data on air pollution and emphysema progression from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) using this analytical approach. We estimate weights for continuous exposure levels using two techniques: quantile binning of the exposure and a semiparametric model for the requisite conditional densities. The latter approach incorporates flexible machine learning methods. We find evidence for the harmful effects of ambient ozone pollution during study follow-up on the progression of emphysema, consistent with previously reported results. We find no evidence of effects of NOx during study follow-up. This investigation demonstrates that analyses based on marginal structural models are feasible in studies of the health effects of air pollution and may address possible sources of bias that traditional regression-based methods fail to address. Further investigation is warranted to understand differences between our findings and previously published results."

High-Throughput Microfluidic Technologies for Rapidly Screening Pollutant-Induced Cell Health Effects.,"Air pollution exposure is linked to diseases spanning multiple physiological systems. However, environmental stress is overwhelmingly associated with several lung diseases. Since the chemical composition of air pollutants varies widely across geographical locations, research on how specific components in pollutant mixtures contribute to cellular dysfunction is needed. In this work, we utilized microscopy-based morphological profiling as a tool to assess the cellular susceptibility to pollutants. Through our analysis, we established morphological profiles of formaldehyde-exposed cells that showed dose-dependent shifts in cell shape profiles correlating with overall cell health. As a real-world proof-of-concept validation, we evaluated the differences in particulate matter (PM) composition across multiple geographical areas, including both urban and suburban communities in Austin, Texas, USA. Data from this real-world study was used to inform a multicombinatorial study involving metals, selenium (Se) and manganese (Mn), which were differentially abundant across PM collection sites. As proof of concept to demonstrate the potential of establishing low-cost, high-throughput combinatorial screening of the biological effects of these metals, we incorporated microfluidic technology to simultaneously generate variable two-component metal mixtures in a multiwell plate format that enabled microscopy-based morphological screening as a proxy for toxicity. Combinatorial analysis of Se and Mn showed dynamic cell responses across a range of concentrations. Interestingly, exposure mixtures containing both Se and Mn yielded healthier cellular phenotypes relative to Se exposure as a single component. These results demonstrate the development of a high-throughput pipeline to detect dynamic biological responses to common air pollutants. Leveraging multiple technologies, we demonstrate the feasibility of a cost-effective approach that can serve as a starting point to inform focused screenings and studies of air pollutant mixtures that affect health outcomes."
Linking urban expansion patterns to lung cancer risk: a nationwide analysis in Chinese cities.,"Urban expansion, with multifaceted urban form changes, has been proved to have profound impact on environmental quality and population health. While existing research has widely explored the link between urban form and respiratory health, most evidence comes from intra-city comparisons within single metropolitan areas, highlighting a need for more representative, nationwide studies. To address this gap, we systematically examined associations between urban expansion characteristics and lung cancer incidence across 180 Chinese cities, using structural equation models with air pollution exposure as a mediator. Our findings indicated that urban expansion characterized by a larger total urban area (β = 0.204,  Our nationwide analysis shows urban expansion characteristics – specifically larger scale, higher density, faster expanding speed, and cropland mixing – significantly elevate lung cancer risk through increased air pollution exposure, with stronger effects in county-level cities. These results provide exploratory evidence that may inform the development of health-oriented urban policies and land use interventions, not only in China but also in other rapidly urbanizing developing countries."

Long-term exposure to ultrafine particles accelerates biological aging and increases respiratory vulnerability in COPD.,"Long-term exposure to particulate matter is a known risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), yet the impact of ultrafine particles (UFPs) remains poorly understood. As COPD is an age-related disease, the potential modifying role of biological age acceleration in UFP-induced respiratory effects warrants investigation. We conducted a longitudinal panel study of 47 COPD patients with three repeated clinic visits in Beijing, China. Annual exposure levels to UFPs were estimated using a land use regression model. Lung function and respiratory inflammation were assessed at each visit. Biological age was quantified using the Klemera-Doubal method (KDM-BA) and PhenoAge algorithms. Associations were estimated using linear mixed-effects models. Overall, each IQR increase in UFPs exposure was associated with a 3.0-year increase in both KDM-BA (95 % CI: 0.2-5.8) and PhenoAge acceleration (95 % CI: 0.1-5.8). Accelerated biological age was associated with reductions in large and small airway function and lung volume. Stratified analysis indicated that individuals with faster biological aging were more susceptible to UFP-related lung injury. Our study provides novel evidence linking long-term UFP exposure to accelerated biological aging and impaired respiratory function in COPD patients. Biological age may serve as a modifier in assessing air pollution-related health risks."
Follow-up of cancer incidence associated with smoke-related PM,"The link between chronic exposure to ambient PM We obtained Victorian Cancer Registry data linked to 2,872 Hazelwood Health Study Adult Cohort members, from August 2014 to December 2022 and analysed all cancers combined and cancer subtypes. Individual fire-related PM In the post-mine fire period, 295 people (14.3/1000 person-years) were diagnosed with 332 new cancers (12.7/1000 person-years). No significant association was found between fire-related PM We found no evidence that this coal mine fire increased cancer incidence. However, it would be premature to rule out potential carcinogenic effects. Cancer has a long latency period, which means it will be necessary to analyse new data as they become available to more conclusively determine the effects of medium-duration, high-level smoke exposure."
Effect of Particulate Matter Pollution on Global Lung Cancer Burden: A Systematic Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 1990-2021.,"Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer mortality globally, with particulate matter pollution (PMP) identified as a critical environmental risk. This study analyzes long-term trends in age-standardized mortality (ASMR) and disability-adjusted life-year rates (ASDR) for PMP-attributable lung cancer, with projections to 2030. Using Global Burden of Disease data, we evaluated temporal trends across age, sex, and Sociodemographic Index (SDI) regions through age-period-cohort and Bayesian models. Global Trends: PMP-related ASMR/ASDR declined significantly over the study period, while ambient PMP (APMP)-attributable rates increased, contrasting with household air pollution (HAP)-related declines. Age and Sex Disparities: Mortality burden shifted toward older populations, with APMP-related deaths rising sharply in the elderly. Males exhibited faster declines in PMP/HAP-related mortality, whereas females faced steeper increases in APMP-attributable risks. SDI variations: High-middle SDI regions consistently had the highest PMP-related mortality, with ASMR trends reflecting industrialization phases. Projections: PMP-related burdens are expected to rise globally, driven by aging populations and persistent pollution in middle-SDI regions. The escalating burden in vulnerable populations demands urgent interventions, including air quality improvement, tobacco control, and enhanced screening, Notably, China consistently exhibited the world's highest PMP-attributable lung cancer ASMR (13.6 per 100 000 in 1990, declining to 10.1 per 100 000 in 2021). Future strategies must integrate gender-specific risk mitigation and environmental-genetic assessments to address disparities."
"Genetic ablation of p16 leads to pulmonary remodeling, pro-senescence response, and immune modulation in mice exposed to low-dose, Sub-chronic, environmental tobacco smoke.","Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2 A, CDKN2A/p16INK4a (p16), is a gene involved in regulating the cell cycle, cellular senescence, and inflammatory responses. The role of p16 in pulmonary immune-inflammatory and cellular senescence responses to low-dose, sub-chronic environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is not known. We hypothesized that p16-deficient (knockout, KO) mice would exhibit adverse lung responses compared to wild-type (WT) mice, characterized by a decline in lung function, impaired immune responses, lung remodeling, and dysregulated inflammatory responses at low-level ETS exposure. C57BL/6J (WT) and p16 knockout, p16 Histological analysis revealed mild alveolar simplification in p16 KO mice compared to WT mice. CDKN2A/p16 KO BALF did not have the same immune cell infiltration or cytokine response as the WT counterparts, where IL-17A, TNF-α, and GM-CSF were significantly elevated, indicating impaired immune response with p16 deficiency. Proteomic analysis revealed significantly elevated proteins related to inflammation, extracellular matrix remodeling, cellular metabolism, pro-senescence, and oxidative stress in p16 KO mice (Kynu, Col5a3, Lamtor3). NLRP3 and PTGS2 (COX-2) activation z-scores were lower in p16 KO mice, while IL33 and CCR5 activation z-scores were higher compared to WT mice. Thus, p16 deficiency amplifies ETS-induced alveolar architecture, impaired immune responses, and altered inflammatory pathways, contributing to heightened susceptibility to emphysema-like changes compared to WT mice even at low ETS levels. This study revealed that p16 deletion alters response to low-level ETS, not necessarily by amplifying the classic 'damage response' but by modifying immune and senescence signaling in the lungs. Overall, p16 has a complex and nuanced protective role in lung health, and careful targeting p16-related pathways could offer therapeutic strategies for mitigating chronic lung diseases."

Impact of Environmental Pollutant Exposures on Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia.,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the second most common pediatric chronic respiratory disorder after asthma. Infants and children with BPD can have markedly different long-term respiratory outcomes despite being born at similar gestational ages, which is partially attributable to environmental exposures. Furthermore, these early life exposures can have lifelong consequences for the respiratory system, including decrements in lung function. In this review, we discuss what is known about the effects of environmental pollutants on respiratory outcomes for individuals born prematurely, and more specifically, those with BPD where data exist. Ultimately, targeting individuals with modifiable risk factors, such as preventable exposures, may improve long-term health outcomes for this vulnerable group."

Air pollution and lung cancer: a comprehensive review.,"Since 2013, air pollution has been recognised as a definite carcinogen by the IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer). This follows major international epidemiological studies, which now show that people living in a polluted environment are more likely to die of lung cancer. Worldwide, air pollution is the second leading cause of premature death and is estimated to be responsible for around 14 % of lung cancers. Fine particles (PM2.5) are particularly studied for their carcinogenic potential, and recent discoveries have given us a better understanding of their pathophysiological link with certain types of cancer, particularly those harboring mutations in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). The lung-cancer research community and clinical scientists should work to reduce sources of atmospheric pollution in the interests of public health, which must be accompanied by an effective fight against climate change, main announced cause of a deterioration in the quality of our common air."
"Subchronic Residual Oil Fly Ash (ROFA) exposure induces oxidative stress in brain, lung, and cardiac tissues and promotes neuroinflammation, with partial attenuation by taurine.","Exposure to particulate matter (PM₂.₅), including Residual Oil Fly Ash (ROFA), triggers oxidative stress and inflammation. Taurine, an antioxidant amino acid, may protect against these effects, but its efficacy against subchronic ROFA exposure is unclear. This study evaluated taurine's protective role in ROFA-induced multi-organ damage and neurobehavioral changes. Male Wistar rats received ROFA (250 µg/day, intranasally) for six weeks, with or without taurine (400 mg/kg/day). Oxidative markers (CAT, SOD, TBARS) were measured in the brain, lungs, heart, and liver. Cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β) were assessed in plasma and brain. Behavior was tested using Open Field, Elevated Plus Maze, and Novel Object Recognition. ROFA increased oxidative stress, reducing catalase in the brain and lungs and raising TBARS. Neuroinflammation was evident via elevated TNF-α and IL-1β and confirmed by histopathology, which revealed Gitter cells and endothelial hypertrophy. ROFA also raised urea levels and caused pulmonary damage. Behaviorally, ROFA increased locomotion (distance traveled and line crossings) without altering anxiety or memory. Taurine attenuated oxidative stress in the liver and kidneys. While taurine treatment alone increased vertical exploratory behavior (rearing), it did not significantly reverse the behavioral or neuropathological changes induced by ROFA exposure. Subchronic ROFA exposure causes multi-organ damage, predominantly in the brain and lungs. Histopathological evidence confirmed significant neuroinflammation. Taurine provides partial, organ-specific protection against oxidative stress but has limited efficacy against neuroinflammation. These findings suggest taurine's benefits are context-dependent, highlighting the need for further research into its mechanisms and potential in combating air pollution-related health effects."
"Exposure to household air pollution in relation to stomach and esophageal cancer in Xuanwei, China.","Household air pollution (HAP) is a global health burden affecting about half of the world's population. In Xuanwei, China, individuals experience high concentrations of various HAP constituents, particularly polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Here, the association between HAP constituents and cause-specific mortality from stomach and esophageal cancer was investigated. The study was conducted in a cohort of 42,420 subjects from Xuanwei, China. Participants were followed from 1976 to 2011. Type of fuel used was collected through a questionnaire and categorized into lifetime smoky vs. other fuel use. Annual exposures were predicted for 43 HAP constituents and 5 clusters were identified using hierarchical clustering. Cox regression was used to estimate the association between lifetime smoky coal use and pollutant clusters with stomach (n = 143) and esophageal (n = 39) cancer. All models were stratified by sex and birth cohort and adjusted for smoking status and education. Lifetime smoky coal use (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.40, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.00, 1.96) and a large PAH cluster, PAH37 (HR = 1.59, 95 % CI: 1.19, 2.13 per standard deviation [SD]), were associated with stomach cancer mortality. Similarly, lifetime smoky coal use (HR = 2.84, 95 % CI:1.38, 5.85) and PAH37 (HR = 1.75, 95 % CI: 1.01, 3.04 per SD) were associated with esophageal cancer mortality. Stratified analyses found that the association between PAH37 and stomach cancer was higher among women compared to men (P-interaction = 0.02). This study identified an association between HAP and risk of stomach and esophageal cancer mortality in a highly exposed population. Future work is needed to investigate potential risk differences by timing of exposure."

Interaction between genetic predisposition to successful ageing and chronic air pollution on lung disease in elderly women: results of the German SALIA cohort.,"To investigate the interplay between the genetic predisposition to successful ageing and air pollution on lung disease in healthy aged German women under the hypothesis that ageing and lung diseases share mechanisms of oxidative stress and inflammation that can be regulated by genetic predisposition and environmental factors. German Study on the influence of Air pollution on Lung function, Inflammation and Aging prospective cohort between baseline (1985-1994) and follow-up (2007-2010). Urban Ruhr area and the adjacent rural Münsterland in Germany. At baseline, 4874 women aged 55 years living between 1985 and 1994 in the setting and at follow-up examination, 834 of them participated. Chronic lung disease was defined as any of asthma, chronic bronchitis, cough (with sputum) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Chronic individual exposures to nitrogen dioxide (NO In 560 women (67-80 years), chronic lung disease was present in 156. Higher exposure to air pollution was associated with increased odds by up to 43% per IQR-increase in NO In elderly women, genetic predisposition based on successful ageing SNPs likely reduces the negative impact of air pollution on chronic lung disease, while a healthy lifestyle further strengthens this association."
Gradual Increase in Lung Cancer Risk Due to Particulate Matter Exposure in Patients With Pulmonary Function Impairments: A Nationwide Korean Database Analysis.,"Lung cancer remains a significant public health concern, with external environmental factors, such as particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), playing a crucial role in its development. This study aimed to assess the interaction between cumulative exposure to PM2.5 and lung function impairment, focusing on the risk of lung cancer in a large Korean population. Data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2007 to 2020 were analyzed with linkage of the national cancer registry. A total of 43,973 participants, including 386 lung cancer cases, were included, with spirometry data available to classify lung function into categories. PM2.5 exposure was quantified using geocoded address information. Logistic regression models with interaction terms were used to evaluate lung cancer risk according to PM2.5 exposure levels and in interaction of lung function categories. A significant increase in lung cancer risk was observed with higher PM2.5 exposure levels, with odds ratios (ORs) of 1.41, 1.59, and 1.68 for the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quartiles, respectively in multivariable models. Stratified analysis showed that the interaction between PM2.5 exposure and obstructive lung function significantly increased lung cancer risk, with ORs of 2.74 for spirometric obstruction and 3.43 for preserved ratio impaired spirometry in the highest PM2.5 quartile. This study suggests the carcinogenic risk of PM2.5 exposure, particularly in individuals with obstructive lung function impairments."
"Ambient air pollutant mixture and lung function among children in Fresno, California.","Ambient air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), ozone (O3), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) have been associated with lower lung function among children. However, the reported associations could be due to correlation with other pollutants. We investigate the relationships between exposures to eight ambient air pollutants and children's lung function and apply mixture analysis to identify key contributors to health effects. The Children's Health and Air Pollution Study (CHAPS) in Fresno, California, is a prospective cohort study that recruited 299 children and assessed their lung function at two visits, at approximately 7 and 9 years of age. The children's forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV1/FVC ratio were standardized using the Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI) race-neutral calculators. We assessed the children's average daily residential exposures to PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen oxides (NOx), NO2, O3, carbon monoxide (CO), elemental carbon (EC), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), during the 1-week, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month periods before each visit, and the 2 years between visits. We applied linear mixed-effect models and quantile-based g-computation (q-gcomp) for statistical analysis. The children's exposures to the eight ambient air pollutants exhibited high intercorrelation: Seven air pollutants were positively correlated, while O3 exposures were negatively correlated with the other pollutants. Higher PM10 was associated with lower FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio, and the associations were strongest for the 3-month exposure timeframe. Q-gcomp also identified PM10 as the key pollutant associated with lower FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio. Among the eight ambient air pollutants, PM10 was the strongest risk factor for impaired lung function among children in Fresno. Ambient air pollution levels in this community exceed regulatory standards and are harmful to children's lung function."
"Occupational Exposure to Ambient Air Pollution: At-Risk Worker Groups, Regulatory and Research Needs An Official American Thoracic Society Workshop Report.","Although health effects of ambient air pollution are well established in the general population, the impact of exposure in working populations remains poorly understood. Outdoor workers are disproportionately exposed to ambient air pollution, particularly with increasing wildfire smoke events and global climate change. An international interdisciplinary group of experts including worker representation assembled to review the current state of knowledge regarding the impact of occupational air pollution exposure on worker health and develop recommendations for research and actions to evaluate, mitigate, and regulate occupational air pollution exposure. The group identified health risks likely resulting from air pollution based on studies of the general population, noting that additional risks may be encountered from coexposures, as well as exertion increasing the work of breathing. High-risk groups were identified, including agricultural workers, construction workers, and wildland firefighters; others working in warehouses and indoor spaces are likely at risk via ambient air pollutant infiltration. It was estimated that at least 20 million outdoor U.S. workers are exposed to air pollution at work, which limits productivity and increases absenteeism. Participants recommended using air quality to guide work modifications and adoption of the hierarchy of exposure controls as a model to reduce exposures, as used by some states and proposed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health for agricultural and other outdoor workers. Existing research supports the urgent need for policies to protect workers from exposure. Research gaps remain, including medical surveillance strategies, improved technology to protect workers, and studies specifically evaluating the impacts of occupational air pollution exposure."
Mast cells are essential in the development of exposure-associated exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in a mouse model.,"Cold air and air pollution are known triggers to induce symptoms in exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). Mast cells are hypothesized to be a key player in the pathogenesis of EIB. This study aims to investigate the role of mast cells using mast cell deficient (Cpa3 Male Cpa3 Inhibition of mast cells by Doxantrazole or mice lacking functional mast cells (Cpa3 Mast cells are crucial in the development of bronchial hyperreactivity and macrophage activation. Additionally, they have a complex interplay with neutrophilic inflammation. These findings highlight the potential of mast cell modulation as therapeutic strategy in exposure-associated EIB."

"Biomarker changes before and after the 2024 peak burning period in healthy, diabetic, and hypertensive residents of Chiang Mai, Thailand.","Burning-related air pollution is a recurrent seasonal problem in Chiang Mai, Thailand, from March to May. Exposure has been linked to pulmonary damage and oxidative stress, measurable via serum Club Cell Protein 16 (CC16) and 8-Iso-prostaglandin F2α (8-iso-PGF2α). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), especially 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP), are emitted during incomplete combustion and may contribute to diabetes and hypertension through oxidative pathways. Few studies have examined how PAH exposure from seasonal air pollution affects lung function biomarkers in individuals with these conditions in this region. A prospective cohort study was conducted in three Chiang Mai locations, following 127 participants with diabetes and/or hypertension during the before-burning (December 2023) and after-burning (May 2024) periods. Urinary 1-OHP measured PAH exposure, while serum CC16 and 8-iso-PGF2α assessed pulmonary damage and oxidative stress. Structured questionnaires captured participant characteristics and symptoms. Quantitative health-risk assessment (QHRA) converted 1-OHP to benzo[a]pyrene-equivalent doses for estimating lifetime cancer risk (LCR) and hazard quotient (HQ). From before- to after-burning, cohort-wide means increased significantly: urinary 1-OHP (0.24 ± 0.05 to 0.90 ± 1.21 μmol/mol Cre;  After burning in Chiang Mai substantially increases PAH exposure, pulmonary injury markers, and oxidative stress in individuals with diabetes and hypertension, with differential effects by comorbidity. Cancer risk thresholds were exceeded in older subgroups despite HQs below non-cancer hazard levels, highlighting the need for targeted protection strategies during burn seasons."
"Prenatal exposure to air pollution affects autophagy, senescence and remodelling proteins in cord blood.","Air pollution increases inflammation and reactive oxygen species that can induce autophagy, thereby leading to airway inflammation and remodelling. However, it is unclear whether prenatal air pollution may impact proteins involved in autophagy. The objectives of the present study were to investigate the associations of prenatal air pollution with proteins indicative of autophagy, senescence and remodelling in infants. We included 387 healthy term newborns from the BILD cohort study and measured 11 proteins: interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-8, matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-3, MMP-9, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AA, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), sirtuin-1, p62, LC3B, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and Beclin-1 in cord blood serum and plasma. We assessed the association of whole pregnancy residential exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO Our results indicate that NO Our findings in healthy term newborns showed that prenatal air pollution exposure is associated with alterations in levels of autophagy-related proteins. For the first time, we identified four distinct clusters of newborns, suggesting that there are different air pollution response patterns in a healthy population."
"Lung cancer clusters and air pollution exposure in Wayne County, Michigan: an autoregressive distributed lag model.","Lung cancer is the most common cancer killer in the world. Although smoking is the biggest risk factor, it is increasingly being discovered that environmental pollution is also associated with the development of lung cancer. Previous studies have discovered the impact of environmental pollution on lung cancer, but it has been difficult to determine the duration of time after exposure in which the risk is greatest. Our goals were to investigate the association of specific air pollutants with lung cancer and to determine the lag time at which the incidence peaks following exposure. The Michigan Cancer Surveillance Program (MCSP) was queried from 1985 to 2018 for every case of lung cancer that occurred in Wayne County during that period. Data was obtained from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for multiple pollutants from 1980 to 2021. Clusters of lung cancer in the county were detected by using SaTScan. Air pollution levels inside and outside the clustered areas were measured. The lagged relationship between pollution exposure and health outcome inside and outside the clustered areas were examined by using autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models, controlling for patient demographic features and meteorological conditions (MCs). Three separate lung cancer clusters encompassing 26 zip codes were detected with a relative risk (RR) larger than 1. These three clusters were all located within urban and industrial areas and experienced higher air pollution than non-cluster areas. After controlling for MCs and sociodemographic variables, the optimal lag dramatically decreased to a shorter responsive period (2-3 years) than previous clinical expectations (9-12 years). Additionally, ozone exposure levels demonstrated shorter lag times inside cluster areas (2 years) than outside cluster areas (3 years). Furthermore, sulfur dioxide levels were significantly associated with lung cancer incidence inside cluster areas, while no pollutant showed a significant relationship in non-cluster areas. Although future studies are required to validate these findings, the ARDL model may play a role in estimating a responsive window for lung cancer incidence. The lag time between exposure to environmental pollutants and development of lung cancer may be shorter than previously thought based on this population-based study. Future research should continue to model air pollution lag times and lung cancer in different settings."
"Restrictive Lung Function Patterns and Sex Differences in Primary School Children Exposed to PM2.5 in Chiang Mai, Northern Thailand.","Northern Thailand experiences annual haze events with fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exceeding standards, posing risks to schoolchildren. This cross-sectional study (Chiang Mai, 2024) evaluated respiratory impacts among primary school children aged 8-12 years.

In situ propagation-based lung computed tomography for large animal models.,"The lung is a complex organ with a hierarchical structure, containing four times more air than tissue. It is in constant contact with environmental factors such as pollution and pathogens, leading to pathological alterations at various hierarchical levels. Because of its intricate structure and continuous movement, lung imaging presents significant challenges for most existing techniques. Recent advancements in phase-contrast computed tomography and photon-counting detectors have greatly enhanced lung imaging capabilities. Specifically, propagation-based imaging (PBI), a phase-contrast method that does not require optical elements, has proven particularly effective at low X-ray dose rates due to the strong phase shifts between lung tissue and aerated regions. This study introduces an in situ imaging approach for large-scale lungs using PBI at the Imaging and Medical Beamline (IMBL) of the Australian Synchrotron. We investigated optimal conditions for PBI, including energy and propagation distance settings, and found that an X-ray beam energy of 70 keV combined with a 7 m propagation distance yields the highest image quality in terms of contrast-to-noise ratio while also delivering the lowest radiation dose. Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulations were performed on the reconstructed volume to calculate absorbed radiation doses in tissues. These findings provide valuable insights for designing future experiments aimed at minimizing radiation exposure and potentially enable in vivo applications in larger animals or even humans."

Assessment of respirable silica in ambient air of Dhaka and evaluation of human health risks.,"Respirable Silica (RS) is a substantial pollutant in urban air, and it is associated with severe health hazards, including lung inflammation, kidney diseases, poor lung function, and silicosis. RS levels in close proximity to occupational and emission sources are widely reported; however, ambient exposure from non-occupational sources is still not properly studied. This study examines the concentration of RS in ambient air during different seasons of the year and the diverse sources that contribute to RS concentrations in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. Ambient fine particulate matter (PM) was collected using a low-volume air sampler on Teflon filters at an average flow rate of 15.4 ± 1.36 L min⁻¹, with each sample collected continuously over 24 h to assure a representative daily exposure at five different locations. RS concentrations were quantified spectrophotometrically, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.05 µg m⁻³. The highest recorded concentration was 14.2 µg m⁻³, while the mean RS concentration was 3.74 ± 3.12 µg m⁻³. Seasonal patterns indicated increased RS concentrations in winter (6.28 µg m⁻³) relative to the pre-monsoon (1.97 µg m⁻³) and post-monsoon (3.74 µg m⁻³) phases. Among the five study sites, the Teacher Student Center (TSC) exhibited the highest RS concentration (7.33 µg m⁻³) due to proximity to metro-rail construction, whereas the academic building site recorded the lowest (0.95 µg m⁻³), indicating relatively cleaner air. Health risk assessments indicated an average hazard quotient (HQ) of 1.25, suggesting significant non-cancer risks, and a cancer risk of 14.2 cases per 10,000, emphasizing the urgent need to address RS exposure. These findings emphasize the substantial public health impact associated with ambient RS pollution in urban environments, urging quick regulatory and mitigation steps in rapidly rising cities such as Dhaka.

"Global, regional, and national sepsis incidence and mortality, 1990-2021: a systematic analysis.","The global burden of sepsis, a life-threatening dysregulated host response to infection leading to organ dysfunction, remains challenging to quantify. We aimed to comprehensively estimate the global, regional, and national burden of sepsis, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and underlying causes of sepsis-related deaths with co-occurring infectious syndromes. We used multiple cause-of-death, hospital, minimally invasive tissue sampling, and linked death certificate and hospital record data representing 149 million deaths, covering 4290 location-years with mortality estimates from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 to capture explicit and implicit sepsis cases and deaths. We estimated age-location-sex-specific fractions of sepsis-related deaths from 195 underlying causes of death and 22 infectious syndromes from 1990 to 2021 using binomial logistic regression models, and estimated sepsis-related deaths using GBD cause-specific mortality estimates. Using 250 million hospital admissions and 7·82 million deaths from hospital data, representing 1310 location-years, we modelled case fatality rates by use of binomial logistic regression, applied to sepsis death estimates to estimate sepsis incidence by age, location, and year. In 2021, we estimated 166 million (95% uncertainty interval 135-201) sepsis cases and 21·4 million (20·3-22·5) all-cause sepsis-related deaths globally, representing 31·5% of total global deaths. Sepsis-related deaths decreased between 1990 and 2019, followed by a surge in 2020 and 2021. As of 2021, individuals aged 15 years and older experienced increases across incidence (230%) and mortality (26·3%) since 1990. Those aged 70 years and older had the highest sepsis-related mortality in 2021 (9·28 million [8·74-9·86] deaths). Sepsis-related deaths from infectious underlying causes decreased from 11·8 million (11·1-12·5) in 1990 to 8·34 million (7·72-9·01) in 2019, then increased by 86·4% to 15·5 million (14·7-16·4) in 2021. Sepsis-related mortality due to non-infectious underlying causes of death increased from 4·69 million (4·35-5·05) in 1990 to 5·81 million (5·40-6·25) in 2021; the leading non-infectious underlying causes of death with sepsis were stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cirrhosis. In 2021, bloodstream infections inclusive of HIV and malaria (3·08 million [2·83-3·35]) and lower respiratory infections inclusive of COVID-19 (11·33 million [1·20-1·47]) were the most prominent infectious syndromes complicating sepsis-related deaths from non-infectious underlying causes, representing a consistent trend since 1990. The global burden of sepsis increased in 2020 and 2021, reversing progress from 1990. Sepsis incidence and mortality increased in people aged 15 years and older, especially those aged 70 years and older, and as a complication of non-infectious underlying causes of death such as stroke, primarily through bloodstream infections and lower respiratory infections. The global burden of sepsis is substantial, and sepsis is increasingly a complication of non-infectious causes of death.

Effect of Ambient Air Pollutants on Acute changes in Pulmonary Variables and Inflammatory Markers in Healthy Adults: A Pilot Study.,"Air pollution is associated with adverse health effects, particularly on respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Smog, prevalent in Northern India, contains particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5) and gaseous pollutants that can impair pulmonary function. Ambient air pollution can be quantified by the air quality index (AQI). Understanding the acute effects of air quality on respiratory physiology and inflammation is essential. A pilot prospective longitudinal observational study evaluated healthy volunteers during high (HAQI, AQI >350) and low pollution (LAQI, AQI <150) phases. Spirometry and impulse oscillometry (IOS) assessed lung function; and biomarkers (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha) were measured from exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and serum. Paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used for analysis. A total of 21 participants (mean age 25.4±7.4 years, female 33.3%, body mass index 23.9±3.5 kg/m Acute air pollution exposure impairs lung function and increases airway resistance in healthy adults. These findings underscore the need for larger longitudinal studies to clarify the mechanisms linking acute air pollution exposure to chronic health outcomes."

"Community Factors and County-Level Cancer Screening, Prevalence, and Mortality.","Cancer screening, prevalence, and mortality vary across US counties; the broad set of community factors associated with these differences are not well understood. To assess the relative importance of diverse community measures for explaining county-level variance in cancer screening, prevalence, and mortality rates for breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers. This geospatial cross-sectional analysis across all US counties used random forest algorithms to estimate the relative importance of 24 community measures-including health behaviors and lifestyle, socioeconomic, and environment factors-as explanatory factors for cancer screening, prevalence, and mortality. For each cancer, county-level cancer screening and prevalence rates were based on a nationally representative 5% sample of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries (2020). The 5-year (2016-2020) mean mortality rates were from the National Cancer Institute's State Cancer Profiles. Neiman Cancer disparity maps geospatially display significant community-factor to cancer-outcome associations via county-level choropleth maps. Data were analyzed from September 2024 through February 2025. Residence in the 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. Outcomes were county-level rates of cancer screening, prevalence, and mortality for breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers. Separate random forest algorithms estimated the relative importance of 24 community measures for each outcome-cancer type combination, and maps display county-level associations. Among a nationally representative 5% of 2020 Medicare Fee-For-Service beneficiaries, 87% were aged 65 years or older. The top ranking explanatory community factors (100% relative importance) for mortality were smoking rate for both lung and colorectal cancers, and the non-Hispanic Black population share for both breast and prostate cancers. For prevalence and screening rates, the top factors were unique for each cancer type. Uninsured rate, unemployment, limited access to health foods, and poor physical health were the top ranked factors for breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer prevalence, respectively. Hispanic population, poverty, air pollution, and Air Toxics Cancer Risk were ranked highest for screening rates, respectively, for each cancer. Two of only 3 environmental factors, Environmental Justice Index and Air Toxics Cancer Risk, had the most top-5 associations for mortality and screening, respectively. Uninsured rates for prevalence and poverty rates for screening were also important across cancer types. In this cross-sectional study of the relative explanatory importance of community measures on cancer screening, prevalence, and mortality rate we found that the ranking of factors varied for each specific cancer and outcome, which can inform targeted population health efforts. Factors that ranked high across cancer types for a given outcome, such as uninsured rates for cancer prevalence, represent opportune targets for future study and broader policy change."

Lung microbiomes' variable responses to dust exposure in mouse models of asthma.,"Inhalation of dust is significant and relevant to health effects. As pollution and climate change worsen in dryland regions, wind currents entrain loose sediment and dust. This potentially disperses toxic geochemical and microbial burdens throughout the region. When inhaled environmental dust and host-associated microbiomes mingle, they pose exposure risks to host respiratory health. The Salton Sea, California's largest lake, is shrinking, thus exposing nearby communities to playa dust. Therefore, we analyze the effect of Salton Sea dust exposure in murine models to relate lung microbial communities and respiratory health. We used an environmental chamber to expose mice to dust filtrate or ambient air and examined the effects of those exposures on lung microbiomes. We found that lung microbial composition varied by dust exposure. Furthermore, dust elicited neutrophil recruitment and immune responses more than mice exposed to ambient air. Sources of dust differentially affected the composition of the lung core microbiome. Lung microbial diversity correlated with neutrophil recruitment as lungs associated with inflammatory responses harbored more diverse microbiomes. Although Salton Sea dust influences dust microbiomes and prevalent taxa, these responses are variable. The composition of lungs exposed to dust collected further from the Salton Sea was more similar to lungs from ambient air exposures; in contrast, dust collected near the Salton Sea yielded lung microbiomes that clustered further from lungs exposed to ambient air. As lakes continue to dry out, we expect greater public health risks in proximal dryland regions, which may correlate with dust microbial dispersal-related changes to lung microbiomes. Dust inhalation can lead to health effects, especially when toxic chemicals and microbes mix in with the dust particles. As California's Salton Sea dries up, it exposes lake bottom sediments to wind, which disperses the dried sediments. To mimic the effect of inhaling Salton Sea dust, we collected and filtered airborne dust to use in exposure experiments with mice in environmental chambers. We predicted that inhaling small dust particles, chemicals, and microbial residues found in this dust would affect mouse respiratory health or change the microbes found inside their lungs. We found that inhaling dust led to lung inflammation, and the dust source influenced the type of microbes found inside mouse lungs. As lakes continue to dry out, we expect greater health risks and changes to lung microbiomes."
"Survival among patients with cancer after a coalmine fire: analysis of registry data in regional Victoria, Australia.","In 2014, a bushfire ignited the Hazelwood coalmine in regional Victoria, Australia, shrouding nearby communities in smoke for 6 weeks. In this study, we examined whether survival decreased among people with cancer in smoke-exposed areas. We identified cancers diagnosed between January 2009 and February 2014, the start of the coalmine fire, from the Victorian Cancer Registry. Tumours were grouped by location as well as subtypes for breast and lung cancers. Smoke exposure was determined by the daily average of PM There was no detectable effect of fire-related PM We found limited evidence that smoke from the Hazelwood coal mine fire reduced survival among people living with cancer. The association with reduced survival among women with breast cancer may be a chance finding. However, this does not rule out an effect and further analyses should follow when more data become available or following other similar disasters."
Equity in Respiratory Health: Actionable Recommendations for Spain.,"Chronic respiratory diseases are a major public health burden, affecting over 7 million people in Spain and representing the third leading cause of death. Conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and lung cancer are heavily influenced by social and environmental determinants, including socioeconomic status, air quality, and smoking. Moreover, the increasingly aging Spanish population and persistent urban pollution levels further expand the burden of these diseases. This article underscores the urgent need to address inequities in respiratory healthcare through comprehensive policy action. To this end, we herein propose measures such as strengthening primary care to ensure early diagnosis, enhancing coordination between community pharmacy, primary and hospital care, incorporating specialised roles such as continuity-of-care nurses, prioritising access to cost-effective innovative treatments, promoting healthy environments, and reinforcing anti-smoking initiatives. We also advocate for inclusion of social determinants of health indicators in electronic health records and for development of patient education programmes. Tackling respiratory health disparities requires targeted strategies that involve all healthcare and social stakeholders to optimise resource use and improve the quality of life of patients with respiratory diseases in Spain. Las enfermedades respiratorias crónicas representan una importante carga para la salud pública, afectando a más de siete millones de personas en España, y constituyendo la tercera causa de muerte. Afecciones como la enfermedad pulmonar obstructiva crónica (EPOC), el asma y el cáncer de pulmón están fuertemente condicionadas por determinantes sociales y medioambientales, entre los que se incluyen el nivel socioeconómico, la calidad del aire y el tabaquismo. Además, el progresivo envejecimiento de la población española y los persistentes niveles de contaminación urbana agravan aún más esta carga. El presente artículo subraya la necesidad urgente de abordar las desigualdades en la atención respiratoria mediante una acción política integral. Con este objetivo, se proponen medidas como el refuerzo de la atención primaria para garantizar un diagnóstico precoz, la mejora de la coordinación entre la farmacia comunitaria, la atención primaria y hospitalaria, la incorporación de roles especializados como las enfermeras de continuidad asistencial, la priorización del acceso a tratamientos innovadores coste-efectivos, la promoción de entornos saludables y el refuerzo de las iniciativas antitabaco. Asimismo, se aboga por la inclusión de indicadores de los determinantes sociales de la salud en las historias clínicas electrónicas, y por el desarrollo de programas de educación para pacientes. Abordar las desigualdades en salud respiratoria requiere estrategias específicas que involucren a todos los agentes sanitarios y sociales, con el fin de optimizar el uso de recursos, y mejorar la calidad de vida de los pacientes con enfermedades respiratorias en España."
"Traditional medicine, environmental exposures, and cultural practices in cancer risk: insights from low- and middle-income countries.","Cancer is a growing public health concern in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), influenced by cultural practices, environmental exposures, and dependence on traditional medicine in addition to biological risk factors. Evidence from peer-reviewed publications published between 2010 and 2025 was combined in this narrative review. According to studies, traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) is used by 35% to 79% of cancer patients in LMICs, which frequently delays biomedical treatment and complicates care. Over 2.4 billion people use biomass fuels for household air pollution (HAP), which has been associated with a two- to three-fold increased risk of lung cancer, especially in women. Furthermore, tobacco smoking contributes to about 2.7 million new cases of cancer in less developed areas each year, highlighting ongoing exposure to avoidable dangers. Findings show that the cancer burden in LMICs is further exacerbated by poor food storage, alcohol use, pesticide exposure, unregulated consumer chemicals, and stigma. These cultural and environmental factors must be addressed in preventative initiatives in addition to biological therapy. Strengthening T&CM regulations, enhancing food safety, upholding alcohol and tobacco legislation, lowering exposures at work and in the home, and introducing culturally-based education to dispel stigma and myths are among the top priorities. This is a narrative review rather than a systematic one; the goal is to map thematic evidence throughout Africa, Asia, and Latin America, providing insights for policy design. Integrated, context-specific, and community-driven approaches are required to eliminate inequities and promote equitable cancer control in LMICs."
Socioeconomic impact on quality of care in pelvic gynecological cancers.,"Several European studies have shown health-related social inequalities in pelvic gynecological cancers, with a social gradient in incidence and mortality, partly explained by more advanced stages at diagnosis in low socioeconomic populations. Disparities in treatment and quality of care in these patients could be another cause of inequality in care. This study evaluates the impact of socioeconomic factors on quality of care for pelvic gynecological cancers (adnexal, uterine corpus, and cervix). This retrospective multicentric cohort study included women diagnosed with pelvic gynecological invasive cancer, between January 1 and December 31, 2022, in six university hospitals in North Paris. Two socioeconomic indicators, the FDep index and the Evaluation of Deprivation and Inequalities in Health Examination Centers (EPICES) score, were collected. The quality of care was assessed using a binary quality indicator based on selected European Society of Gynecological Oncology (ESGO) quality indicators for each cancer. We compared the ""Non-adherence to Quality Indicator"" (NAQI) group, where one or more of the ESGO quality indicators were not met, to the ""Adherence to Quality Indicator"" (AQI) group using univariate analysis. An analysis of the time to first treatment, according to FDep and EPICES groups, using a Kaplan-Meier, estimation was completed. A total of 189 patients were included: 50 with ovarian cancer, 76 with endometrial cancer, and 63 with cervical cancer. Ninety-nine patients (52.4%) belonged to the NAQI group and 90 patients (46.7%) to the AQI group. Patients were significantly in poorer general condition and presented more advanced Federation International of Gynecology Obstetrics (FIGO) stages in the NAQI than in the AQI group (ASA score 3-4: 20/84 [23.8%] vs. 5/76 (6.6%), P < 0.01 and FIGO III-IV stage: 55/99 [55.6%] vs. 35/90 [38.9%], P = 0.03). There was no significant difference for socioeconomic indicators between the NAQI and the AQI groups (FDep quintiles 3-4-5 = 41/99 (41.4%) vs. FDep quintiles 1-2 = 39/90 (43.3%), P = 0.91; EPICES score ≤ 30 = 31/63 (49.2%) vs. EPICES score > 30 = 21/51 (41.2%), P = 0.50). According to FDep and EPICES groups, we found no difference in the time to first treatment. We found no socioeconomic impact on hospital quality of care in pelvic gynecological cancers."
Adverse Health Consequences of Poor Air Quality in Nepal: A Wake-Up Call.,"Literatures shows that poor air quality index (AQI) is associated with several adverse health impacts, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, tuberculosis, cancer, pneumonia, cataracts, heart diseases, and mental health disorders. Nepal, one of the lower-middle-income countries, has become vulnerable to adverse health impacts due to poor AQI over time. The capital city of Nepal, Kathmandu, is frequently placed as one of the most polluted cities by IQAir. As such, this statement marks a caution for policymakers and the public to be aware of the future effects of prolonged exposure to air pollution and highlights its causative factors. To solve this burgeoning issue, because of the significant rise in urbanization and population growth, mitigation strategies such as creating awareness, reducing vehicular emission, reducing forest fires, creating and identifying vulnerability maps risk zones for forest fires, switching to electronic vehicles and personal interventions such as staying indoors and reducing physical outdoor activity, wearing face masks must be focused and given priority. Although our study is limited in its methodology and findings, it helps establish a policy base to underscore the need for longitudinal cohort studies to generate further evidences pertaining to not up to par air quality levels and their subsequent health impacts in the Nepalese population."
Efficiency Analysis Based on Two-Stage Undesirable Dynamic SBM Model.,"In previous studies exploring the causes of lung cancer, smoking has long been recognized as the primary risk factor, while the impact of air pollution has been relatively overlooked. This is particularly true in Asia, where efficiency evaluation studies examining the relationship between industrial and transportation-related pollution and lung cancer remain limited. Moreover, existing literature often relies on static or single-stage models, with limited integration of dynamic and multi-stage approaches to capture the complex interactions between pollution and health outcomes. This study is the first to apply a Two-stage Undesirable Dynamic SBM model to analyze the efficiency relationship between air pollution and lung cancer, using 22 counties and cities in Taiwan as DMUs. It systematically evaluates the ""production and environment efficiency"" in the first stage and the ""life health and well-being efficiency"" in the second stage. By addressing a significant gap in Asian research on pollution-related lung cancer efficiency, this study also develops an analytical framework with high relevance for policy applications. The model provides robust empirical evidence to support government initiatives in promoting precision health and sustainable development goals (SDG 3 and SDG 11)."

Burning of municipal waste in household furnaces and the health of their owners.,"The aim of the study was to determine the scale of emission and airborne dispersion of selected pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, TVOC, HCHO) associated with the combustion of various types of municipal waste (MW), its mixed stream and separate fractions, in a household furnace, as compared to conventional (CF) and alternative (AF) fuels. We demonstrated that each type of fuel (AF, CF, AFw) combusted in a household furnace is a significant source of air pollutants, especially fine PM2.5 particles, whose concentrations exceeded the limit values (3.1-17.2 times for PM2.5 and 0.5-7.4 times for PM10). The combustion of MW in household furnaces generated higher levels of PM2.5 (up to 345 µg/m"
Understanding canine oral neoplasia: intrinsic rather than extrinsic features represent key risk factors in a 39-year analysis.,"Canine oral neoplasia is often detected late in the course of the disease, necessitating radical surgeries frequently combined with adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy for positive outcomes. Although there has been extensive analytical and epidemiologic work on human oral cancer, research in veterinary medicine has been lacking. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors associated with canine oral neoplasia to enhance early detection by improving screening. Patient data from 1985 to 2024 from the University of California-Davis Veterinary Teaching Hospital were bulk extracted to determine prevalence as well as the effect of clinical and environmental risk factors, including sex, breed, oral location, air quality, and periodontal disease status. The median air quality index (AQI) data were extrapolated from the Environmental Protection Agency's database. Periodontal disease status was evaluated on patient CT scans. The incidence of oral tumors was 4.59/1,000 patients. The median age upon diagnosis was 9.66 years, and 3 breeds were identified as significantly at risk compared to the general patient population. Air quality index, geographical location, and periodontal disease were not associated with oral neoplasia. Different tumor histologies had distinct oral predilection sites. Overall, there was a significant correlation between age/breed and oral neoplasms. Tumor locations were significantly different for each pathology. Other risk factors did not play a substantial role in disease. These findings can aid veterinarians and researchers in targeting screening and treatment strategies in high-risk dogs."
Association between Air Quality Index and the risk of rosacea: a nationwide population-based cohort study.,"Air pollution is associated with several inflammatory skin disorders. However, the association between air quality and rosacea remains unclear. To investigate the association between the Air Quality Index (AQI) and incidence of rosacea. In total, 21 709 479 participants without rosacea before 2008 were recruited from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The long-term average AQI value for each participant was acquired from the Taiwan Air Quality Monitoring System Network and calculated from 1 January 2008 until the diagnosis of rosacea, withdrawal from the National Health Insurance programme, or 31 December 2018. We observed a significant association between AQI and the incidence of rosacea, with each unit elevation in the AQI increasing the risk of rosacea by 5%. We then categorized participants equally into four groups by quantiles (Q) of AQI values, with mean AQI values of: Q1, 69.0 (SD 6.4); Q2, 79.0 (SD 2.3); Q3, 89.9 (SD 3.6); and Q4, 103.9 (SD 6.8). Compared with the Q1 group, the Q2, Q3 and Q4 cohorts exhibited 1.82-fold, 4.48-fold and 7.22-fold increased risk of rosacea, respectively. Additionally, exposure to particulate matter (PM)2.5 (airborne particulate matter with a diameter ≤ 2.5 μm), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide increased the risk of rosacea, whereas exposure to PM10 (airborne PM with a diameter ≤ 10 μm) was associated with a lower risk. This study supported a significant dose-response relationship between AQI and the incidence of rosacea."

Association of air quality index (AQI) with incidence of atopic dermatitis in Taiwan: A nationwide population-based cohort study.,"Air pollutants may aggravate atopic dermatitis (AD). However, the association between Air Quality Index (AQI) and incidence of AD remains unknown. To investigate association between AQI and incidence of AD, using the nationwide cohort in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). We included 21,278,938 participants from the NHIRD not diagnosed with AD before 2008. Long-term average AQI value, obtained from the Taiwan Air Quality Monitoring System Network, before AD diagnosis was calculated and linked for each participant. 199,205 incident cases of AD were identified from 2008 to 2018. Participants were classified into 4 quantiles (Q) by AQI value. With the lowest quantile, Q1, as reference, the AD risk increased significantly in the Q2 group (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-1.65), Q3 group (aHR: 4.71, 95% CI: 3.78-6.04), and was highest in the Q4 group (aHR: 13.20, 95% CI: 10.86-16.60). As AQI treated as a continuous variable, an increase of 1 unit of AQI value added 7% of AD risk (aHR, 1.07, 95% CI: 1.07-1.08). The NHIRD lacks detailed information on individual subjects. The results demonstrated a significant positive association between AQI and incidence of AD with a clear dose-response relationship."
Exploring the relationship between air quality index and lung cancer mortality in India: predictive modeling and impact assessment.,"The Air Quality Index (AQI) in India is steadily deteriorating, leading to a rise in the mortality rate due to Lung Cancer. This decline in air quality can be attributed to various factors such as PM 2.5, PM 10, and Ozone (O3). To establish a relationship between AQI and Lung Cancer, several predictive models including Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, ANN, Random Forest Regression, and XGBoost Regression were employed to estimate pollutant levels and Air Quality Index in India. The models relied on publicly available state-wise Air Pollution Dataset. Among all the models, the XGBoost Regression displayed the highest accuracy, with pollutant level estimations reaching an accuracy range of 81% to 98% during training and testing. The second-highest accuracy range was achieved by Random Forest. The paper also explores the impact of increasing pollution levels on the rising mortality rate among lung cancer patients in India."

"Analgesia quality index improves the quality of postoperative pain management: a retrospective observational study of 14,747 patients between 2014 and 2021.","The application of artificial intelligence patient-controlled analgesia (AI-PCA) facilitates the remote monitoring of analgesia management, the implementation of mobile ward rounds, and the automatic recording of all types of key data in the clinical setting. However, it cannot quantify the quality of postoperative analgesia management. This study aimed to establish an index (analgesia quality index (AQI)) to re-monitor and re-evaluate the system, equipment, medical staff and degree of patient matching to quantify the quality of postoperative pain management through machine learning. Utilizing the wireless analgesic pump system database of the Cancer Hospital Affiliated with Nantong University, this retrospective observational study recruited consecutive patients who underwent postoperative analgesia using AI-PCA from June 1, 2014, to August 31, 2021. All patients were grouped according to whether or not the AQI was used to guide the management of postoperative analgesia: The control group did not receive the AQI guidance for postoperative analgesia and the experimental group received the AQI guidance for postoperative analgesia. The primary outcome was the incidence of moderate-to-severe pain (numeric rating scale (NRS) score ≥ 4) and the second outcome was the incidence of total adverse reactions. Furthermore, indicators of AQI were recorded. A total of 14,747 patients were included in this current study. The incidence of moderate-to-severe pain was 26.3% in the control group and 21.7% in the experimental group. The estimated ratio difference was 4.6% between the two groups (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.2% to 6.0%; P < 0.001). There were significant differences between groups. Otherwise, the differences in the incidence of total adverse reactions between the two groups were nonsignificant. Compared to the traditional management of postoperative analgesia, application of the AQI decreased the incidence of moderate-to-severe pain. Clinical application of the AQI contributes to improving the quality of postoperative analgesia management and may provide guidance for optimum pain management in the postoperative setting."
Air quality prediction by machine learning models: A predictive study on the indian coastal city of Visakhapatnam.,"Clean air is critical component for health and survival of human and wildlife, as atmospheric pollution is associated with a number of significant diseases including cancer. However, due to rapid industrialization and population growth, activities such as transportation, household, agricultural, and industrial processes contribute to air pollution. As a result, air pollution has become a significant problem in many cities, especially in emerging countries like India. To maintain ambient air quality, regular monitoring and forecasting of air pollution is necessary. For that purpose, machine learning has emerged as a promising technique for predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) compared to conventional methods. Here we apply the AQI to the city of Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, India, focusing on 12 contaminants and 10 meteorological parameters from July 2017 to September 2022. For this purpose, we employed several machine learning models, including LightGBM, Random Forest, Catboost, Adaboost, and XGBoost. The results show that the Catboost model outperformed other models with an R"
An Intelligent IoT-Cloud-Based Air Pollution Forecasting Model Using Univariate Time-Series Analysis.,"Air pollution is a significant environmental issue affecting public health and ecosystems worldwide, resulting from various sources such as industrial activities, vehicle emissions, and fossil fuel burning. Air pollution contributes to climate change and can cause several health problems, such as respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. A potential solution to this problem has been proposed by using different artificial intelligence (AI) and time-series models. These models are implemented in the cloud environment to forecast the Air Quality Index (AQI) utilizing Internet of things (IoT) devices. The recent influx of IoT-enabled time-series air pollution data poses challenges for traditional models. Various approaches have been explored to forecast AQI in the cloud environment using IoT devices. The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of an IoT-Cloud-based model for forecasting the AQI under different meteorological conditions. To achieve this, we proposed a novel BO-HyTS approach that combines seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and long short-term memory (LSTM) and fine-tuned it by using Bayesian optimization to predict air pollution levels. The proposed BO-HyTS model can capture both linear and nonlinear characteristics of the time-series data, thus augmenting the accuracy of the forecasting process. Additionally, several AQI forecasting models, including classical time-series, machine learning, and deep learning, are employed to forecast air quality from time-series data. Five statistical evaluation metrics are incorporated to evaluate the effectiveness of models. While comparing the various algorithms among themselves becomes difficult, a non-parametric statistical significance test (Friedman test) is applied to assess the performance of the different machine learning, time-series, and deep learning models. The findings reveal that the proposed BO-HyTS model produced significantly better results than their competitor's, providing the most accurate and efficient forecasting model, with an MSE of 632.200, RMSE of 25.14, Med AE of 19.11, Max Error of 51.52, and MAE of 20.49. The results of this study provide insights into the future patterns of AQI in various Indian states and set a standard for these states as governments develop their healthcare policies accordingly. The proposed BO-HyTS model has the potential to inform policy decisions and enable governments and organizations to protect better and manage the environment beforehand."
"Evaluation of the health risk using multi-pollutant air quality health index: case study in Tianjin, China.","Air pollution imposes a significant burden on public health. Compared with the popular air quality index (AQI), the air quality health index (AQHI) provides a more comprehensive approach to measuring mixtures of air pollutants and is suitable for overall assessments of the short-term health effects of such mixtures. We established an AQHI and cumulative risk index (CRI)-AQHI for Tianjin using single-and multi-pollutant models, respectively, as well as environmental, meteorological, and daily mortality data of residents in Tianjin between 2018 and 2020. Compared with the AQI, the AQHI and CRI-AQHI established herein correlated more closely with the exposure-response relationships of the total mortality effects on residents. For each increase in the interquartile range of the AQHI, CRI-AQHI and AQI, the total daily mortality rates increased by 2.06, 1.69 and 0.62%, respectively. The AQHI and CRI-AQHI predicted daily mortality rate of residents more effectively than the AQI, and the correlations of AQHI and CRI-AQHI with health were similar. Our AQHI of Tianjin was used to establish specific (S)-AQHIs for different disease groups. The results showed that all measured air pollutants had the greatest impact on the health of persons with chronic respiratory diseases, followed by lung cancer, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. The AQHI of Tianjin established in this study was accurate and dependable for assessing short-term health risks of air pollution in Tianjin, and the established S-AQHI can be used to separately assess health risks among different disease groups."
Critical air pollutant assessments and health effects attributed to PM,"The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in air quality index (AQI) values before, during, and after lockdown, as well as to evaluate the number of hospitalizations due to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases attributed to atmospheric PM Daily air quality records were obtained from the global air quality index project and the US Environmental Protection Administration (EPA). In this research, the AirQ+ model was used to quantify health consequences attributed to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of <2.5 μm (PM The results of this study showed positive correlations between air pollution levels and reductions in pollutant levels during and after the lockdown. PM Our results support the general finding that anthropogenic activities cause significant health threats, which were paradoxically revealed during a global health crisis/challenge."
"Spatial distribution and influencing factors of thyroid cancer hospitalization rate among rural residents in Fujian Province, China from 2012 to 2016.","This study aimed to explore the spatial distribution and influencing factors of thyroid cancer hospitalization rates in Fujian Province from 2012 to 2016. Hospitalization reimbursement records for thyroid cancer were obtained from 2025 hospitals in Fujian Province from 2012 to 2016. The Moran's I method was used for spatial autocorrelation analysis and to further draw a spatial cluster map in Fujian. Geographic detectors were used to explore the effect of risk factors on spatial heterogeneity of inpatient service utilization for thyroid cancer. The study showed that there was obvious temporal and spatial heterogeneity in the utilization rate of inpatient services for thyroid cancer in Fujian Province, which were mainly concentrated in Fuzhou, with Lianjiang County as the center, and the gathering area involves 26 counties and cities. Among a variety of environmental factors, air quality index (AQI) (q = 0.481), carbon sequestration (q = 0.161), and carbon emissions (q = 0.155) were the main factors affecting the hospitalization rates. AQI and carbon emissions were generally positively correlated with hospitalization rates, and carbon sequestration was negatively correlated. After the interaction of the two factors, the interpretation of the hospitalization rate was enhanced. The obvious spatial heterogeneity will help the relevant departments to adjust measures to local conditions and allocate medical resources rationally to ease the pressure of seeking medical attention in high-demand areas."
Life-course exposure to air pollution and biological ageing in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936.,"Exposure to air pollution is associated with a range of diseases. Biomarkers derived from DNA methylation (DNAm) offer potential mechanistic insights into human health differences, connecting disease pathogenesis and biological ageing. However, little is known about sensitive periods during the life course where air pollution might have a stronger impact on DNAm, or whether effects accumulate over time. We examined associations between air pollution exposure across the life course and DNAm-based markers of biological ageing. Data were derived from the Scotland-based Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. Participants' residential history was linked to annual levels of fine particle (PM We included 525 individuals with 1782 observations. In the total sample, increased air pollution around 1970 was associated with higher epigenetic age (AQI: b = 0.322 year, 95 %CI: 0.088, 0.555) measured with Horvath DNAmAge in late adulthood. We found shorter DNAmTL among males with higher air pollution around 1980 (AQI: b = -0.015 kilobase, 95 %CI: -0.027, -0.004) and among females with higher exposure around 1935 (AQI: b = -0.017 kilobase, 95 %CI: -0.028, -0.006). Findings were more consistent for the pollutants PM We tested the life-course relationship between air pollution and DNAm-based biomarkers. Air pollution around birth and in young-to-middle adulthood is linked to accelerated epigenetic ageing and telomere-associated ageing in later life."
Wildfire Impact on Indoor and Outdoor PAH Air Quality.,"Air quality impacts from wildfires are poorly understood, particularly indoors. As frequencies increase, it is important to optimize methodologies to understand and reduce chemical exposures from wildfires. Public health recommendations use air quality estimates from outdoor stationary air monitors, discounting indoor air conditions, and do not consider chemicals in the vapor phase, known to elicit adverse effects. We investigated vapor-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in indoor and outdoor air before, during, and after wildfires using a community-engaged research approach. Paired passive air samplers were deployed at 15 locations across four states. Twelve unique PAHs were detected only in outdoor air during wildfires, highlighting a PAH exposure mixture for future study. Heavy-molecular-weight (HMW) outdoor PAH concentrations and average Air Quality Index (AQI) values were positively correlated ("
Towards Integrated Air Pollution Monitoring and Health Impact Assessment Using Federated Learning: A Systematic Review.,"Environmental issues such as environmental pollutions and climate change are the impacts of globalization and become debatable issues among academics and industry key players. One of the environmental issues which is air pollution has been catching attention among industrialists, researchers, and communities around the world. However, it has always neglected until the impacts on human health become worse, and at times, irreversible. Human exposure to air pollutant such as particulate matters, sulfur dioxide, ozone and carbon monoxide contributed to adverse health hazards which result in respiratory diseases, cardiorespiratory diseases, cancers, and worst, can lead to death. This has led to a spike increase of hospitalization and emergency department visits especially at areas with worse pollution cases that seriously impacting human life and health. To address this alarming issue, a predictive model of air pollution is crucial in assessing the impacts of health due to air pollution. It is also critical in predicting the air quality index when assessing the risk contributed by air pollutant exposure. Hence, this systemic review explores the existing studies on anticipating air quality impact to human health using the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI). From the extensive review, we highlighted research gaps in this field that are worth to inquire. Our study proposes to develop an AI-based integrated environmental and health impact assessment system using federated learning. This is specifically aims to identify the association of health impact and pollution based on socio-economic activities and predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) for impact assessment. The output of the system will be utilized for hospitals and healthcare services management and planning. The proposed solution is expected to accommodate the needs of the critical and prioritization of sensitive group of publics during pollution seasons. Our finding will bring positive impacts to the society in terms of improved healthcare services quality, environmental and health sustainability. The findings are beneficial to local authorities either in healthcare or environmental monitoring institutions especially in the developing countries."
Elevated air quality index and fine particulate matter levels contribute to the poor prognosis and progression of nonsmall-cell lung cancer: A cohort study combined with external validation.,"Poor air quality can result in a variety of respiratory disorders. However, the air quality index (AQI) and the level of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on the progression and prognosis of nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are unclear. We launched a cohort study focused on the relationship between air quality and overall survival as well as progression, incorporating data from 590 patients with NSCLC in our medical center between November 1, 2013 and March 1, 2016. Forty-nine patients from Sichuan Cancer Hospital were used for validation. Cases with poorer AQI 6 months before NSCLC diagnosis were more likely to progress to stage III to IV NSCLC than controls (OR = 2.61, 95% CI 1.35-5.24, p = 0.005). Similarly, if exposed to high levels of PM2.5 during these 6 months, overall survival was poor (HR [95% CI] = 1.53 [1.13, 2.07], p = 0.006). According to multivariate analysis, age, gender, KPS, PM2.5, hyperlipemia, and NSCLC stage were independent risk factors of overall survival. A predictive model developed by these factors above yielded a favorable agreement (C-index = 0.758) on the calibration curve. External validation was conducted by 46 patients from Sichuan Cancer Hospital displaying an AUC of 0.724 (0.684-0.763). PM2.5 and AQI levels affect disease progression and long-term survival in NSCLC patients. An overall survival prediction model based on the PM2.5 level can help clinicians predict the risk of death in NSCLC."
Pollution characteristics and human health risk assessments of toxic metals and particle pollutants via soil and air using geoinformation in urbanized city of Pakistan.,"Toxic metals and particle pollutants in urbanized cities have significantly increased over the past few decades mainly due to rapid urbanization and unplanned infrastructure. This research aimed at estimating the concentration of toxic metals and particle pollutants and the associated risks to public health across different land-use settings including commercial area (CA), urban area (UA), residential area (RA), and industrial area (IA). A total of 47 samples for both soil and air were collected from different land-use settings of Faisalabad city in Pakistan. Mean concentrations of toxic metals such as Mn, Zn, Pb, Ni, Cr, Co, and Cd in all land-use settings were 92.68, 4.06, 1.34, 0.16, 0.07, 0.03, and 0.02 mg kg"
CD25-T,"Intratumoral regulatory T cell (Treg) abundance associates with diminished anti-tumor immunity and poor prognosis in human cancers. Recent work demonstrates that CD25, the high affinity receptor subunit for IL-2, is a selective target for Treg depletion in mouse and human malignancies; however, anti-human CD25 antibodies have failed to deliver clinical responses against solid tumors due to bystander IL-2 receptor signaling blockade on effector T cells, which limits their anti-tumor activity. Here we demonstrate potent single-agent activity of anti-CD25 antibodies optimized to deplete Tregs whilst preserving IL-2-STAT5 signaling on effector T cells, and demonstrate synergy with immune checkpoint blockade in vivo. Pre-clinical evaluation of an anti-human CD25 (RG6292) antibody with equivalent features demonstrates, in both non-human primates and humanized mouse models, efficient Treg depletion with no overt immune-related toxicities. Our data supports the clinical development of RG6292 and evaluation of novel combination therapies incorporating non-IL-2 blocking anti-CD25 antibodies in clinical studies."
Trends in Peripheral Nerve Block Usage in Mastectomy and Lumpectomy: Analysis of a National Database From 2010 to 2018.,"Compared to general anesthesia, regional anesthesia confers several benefits including improved pain control and decreased postoperative opioid consumption. While the benefits of peripheral nerve blocks (PNB) have been well studied, there are little epidemiological data on PNB usage in mastectomy and lumpectomy procedures. The primary objective of our study was to assess national trends of the annual proportion of PNB use in breast surgery from 2010 to 2018. We also identified factors associated with PNB use for breast surgery. We identified lumpectomy and mastectomy surgical cases with and without PNB between 2010 and 2018 using the Anesthesia Quality Institute National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry (AQI NACOR). We modeled the nonlinear association between year of procedure and PNB use with segmented mixed-effects logistic regression clustered on facility identifier. The association between PNB use and year of procedure, age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status (ASA PS), facility type, facility region, weekday, and tissue expander use was also modeled using mixed-effects logistic regression. Of the 189,854 surgical cases from 2010 to 2018 that met criteria, 86.2% were lumpectomy cases and 13.8% were mastectomy cases. The proportion of lumpectomy cases with PNB was <0.1% in 2010 and increased each subsequent year to 1.9% in 2018 (trend P < .0001). The proportion of mastectomy cases with PNB was 0.5% in 2010 and 13% in 2018 (trend P < .0001). The year 2014 was the breakpoint selected for segmented regression. Before 2014, the odds of PNB among the mastectomy cases was not significantly different from year to year. After 2014, the odds of PNB increased by 2.24-fold each year (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.00-2.49; P < .001); interaction test for pre-2014 versus post-2014 was P < .001. Similar trends were seen in the lumpectomy cases, where after 2014, the odds of PNB increased by 2.03-fold (95% CI, 1.81-2.27; P < .001); interaction test for pre-2014 versus post-2014 was P < .001. In the mastectomy cohort, year of procedure ≥2014, female sex, facility region, and tissue expander use were associated with higher odds of PNB. For lumpectomy cases, year of procedure ≥2014 and facility region were associated with higher odds of PNB use. We found increased annual utilization of PNB for mastectomy and lumpectomy since 2010, although absolute prevalence is low. PNB use was associated with year of procedure for both lumpectomy and mastectomy, particularly post-2014."
Two birds with one stone: oyster mushroom mediated bimetallic Au-Pt nanoparticles for agro-waste management and anticancer activity.,"Agriculture has the most significant contribution in fulfilling the basic human need, sustaining life, and strengthening the economy of any country. To feed the exploding population of the world, there has been a quantum jump in the production of agricultural commodities, which has led to the production of a substantial considerable quantity of agricultural and agro-industrial wastes. The bulks of these wastes are lignocellulosic in nature and consist of three main polymeric constituents, i.e., cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, which are recalcitrant. The primary significant portions of these remain unutilized and are burnt in the field, leading to severe environmental aggression and wastage of resource. Farmers across the globe, including India, burn these agricultural wastes in their thousands of acre land, which contribute to spoiling the air quality index (AQI). This is very harmful, especially to children, pregnant women, old adults, and for patients suffering from respiratory diseases. The current manuscript sets up an agro-waste management platform by using paddy straw as a substrate for the production of nutritionally and medically rich oyster mushroom, Pleurotus florida (Pf) and which is further used in the green synthesis of bimetallic (gold-platinum) Au-Pt nanoparticle. Yield performance and biological efficiency of Pf were calculated from the degraded paddy straw. The green synthesized Au-Pt NPs were structurally characterized by ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and zeta potential analysis. The prepared NPs showed a face-centered cubic crystal structure, icosahedral shape with a mean particle size of 16 nm. Furthermore, we examined the cytotoxic activity of Au-Pt NPs using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and apoptosis by propidium iodide assay. We found that Au-Pt NPs exerted apoptotic activity on the human colon cancer cell line (HCT 116) in a dose-dependent manner from 12.5 to 200 μg/mL. Overall, our findings create a prototype and open a new door to synthesizing functional nanoparticle by using oyster mushroom as the substrate for paddy straw agro-waste management and the applicability of Pf in the synthesis of eco-friendly Au-Pt NPs. This is the first kind of approach that kills two birds with one stone."
"Correlations between Meteorological Indicators, Air Quality and the COVID-19 Pandemic in 12 Cities across China.","COVID-19 is a global pandemic. The purpose of this study is to explore correlations between the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and meteorological indicators from cities across China. We collected daily data of the cumulative number of infected, recovered and death cases, and the meteorological indicators including average temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, precipitation and air quality index (AQI) from 12 cities in China during the period of Jan 23 to Feb 22, 2020. Correlation tests were chosen for data analysis. The average temperature and AQI showed significant association with the mortality rate of COVID-19. The mortality rate was not correlated with wind speed, relative humidity or precipitation. Meanwhile, higher average temperatures and more precipitation were beneficial for the recovery rate of COVID-19, but the recovery rate was not correlated with wind speed, relative humidity or AQI. Our study provides a new basis for correlations between COVID-19, meteorological indicators and air quality index, which can help authorities to combat COVID-19."
"Differential expression profiling of transcripts of IDH1, CEA, Cyfra21-1, and TPA in stage IIIa non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of smokers and non-smokers cases with air quality index.","Smoking tobacco is the major hazard for lung cancer in Indian subcontinent especially men, compare to woman where, other important risk factors such as air pollutions are responsible. So, the aim of the study is to compare chronic smokers (CS) and non-smokers living in areas with air quality categorized as poor (AQI 201-300) or moderate (AQI 101-200). We measured the expression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) biomarkers;. IDH1, CEA, Cyfra21-1, and TPA through quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) and compared the levels of upregulation of the transcripts in stage IIIa NSCLC over control benign tissues among the smoking and AQI settings. Though the all biomarkers were significantly up-regulated in tumor tissues compared to control benign tissues, the fold change increase of IDH1 and CEA was highest in CS-poor/moderate AQI, followed by non-smokers-poor AQI and non-smokers moderate AQI. This indicates the aggressiveness and poor prognosis in CS living in either poor or moderate AQI areas. The level of Cyfra21-1 was lower in in the CS groups in comparison to non-smokers in the poor AQI area. This suggest higher Lung Squamous cell carcinoma histology in non-smokers living areas with poor AQI. Hence, we conclude that poor air quality can be as injurious for lung cancers as chronic smoking."
Characteristics of patients with endometrial hyperplasia under different air quality index conditions.,"Air pollution has been widely recognized to pose a threat to health. Urban outdoor air pollution was listed as the 14th biggest risk factor for global deaths in 2004 in the Global Health Risks report published by the World Health Organization in 2009. Many past studies have indicated that exposure to environmental contaminants promotes changes in the internal mechanisms of diseases, including the infection of various systems in the body, hormonal changes, and vascular proliferation. These changes may be related to the severity of endometrial hyperplasia. Therefore, this study used the air quality monitoring data of the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) to examine the effects of air pollutant concentration on patients with endometrial hyperplasia. This population-based nationwide study used data for 2002-2013 from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. Patients who developed endometrial hyperplasia before 2002 were excluded. In total, 14,883 patients with endometrial hyperplasia were tracked. The exposure levels and air quality index (AQI) values in this study were based on the taiwan air quality monitoring network data collected by the EPA from 2000 to 2013. The data were further divided into the good air quality group (AQI ≤ 50) and poor air quality group (AQI > 50). The study used linear regression model to estimate the correlation linking air pollutant concentration with endometrial hyperplasia. The results indicated that, in comparison to endometrial hyperplasia patients who were exposed to air with good quality, those exposed to air with poor quality had a higher average age (p < 0.001) and higher proportion of living in southern Taiwan (p < 0.001), as well as higher rates of diabetes (p < 0.001), hyperlipidemia (p < 0.001), hypertension, cerebrovascular diseases (p = 0.024), cerebral vascular accidents (p = 0.024), and chronic kidney disease (p < 0.001). The patients with endometrial hyperplasia in poor AQI area had severe comorbidity. Thus, attention must be paid to the improvement of air quality and the implementation of preventive measures against contaminants."

SEER*Educate: Use of Abstracting Quality Index Scores to Monitor Improvement of All Employees.,"Integral parts of the Seattle-Puget Sound's Cancer Surveillance System registry's continuous improvement model include the incorporation of SEER*Educate into its training program for all staff and analyzing assessment results using the Abstracting Quality Index (AQI). The AQI offers a comprehensive measure of overall performance in SEER*Educate, which is a Web-based application used to personalize learning and diagnostically pinpoint each staff member's place on the AQI continuum. The assessment results are tallied from 6 abstracting standards within 2 domains: incidence reporting and coding accuracy. More than 100 data items are aligned to 1 or more of the 6 standards to build an aggregated score that is placed on a continuum for continuous improvement. The AQI score accurately identifies those individuals who have a good understanding of how to apply the 6 abstracting standards to reliably generate high quality abstracts."

The National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry.,"The Anesthesia Quality Institute (AQI) was chartered in 2008 by the American Society of Anesthesiologists to develop the National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry (NACOR). In this Technical Communication, we will describe how data enter NACOR, how they are authenticated, and how they are analyzed and reported. NACOR accepts case-level administrative, clinical, and quality capture data from voluntarily participating anesthesia practices and health care facilities in the United States. All data are transmitted to the AQI in summary electronic files generated by billing, quality capture, and electronic health care record software, typically on a monthly basis. All data elements are mapped to fields in the NACOR schema in accordance with a publicly available data dictionary. Incoming data are loaded into NACOR by AQI technologists and are subject to both manual and automated review to identify systematically missing elements, miscoding, and inadvertent corruption. Data are deidentified in compliance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act regulations. The database server of AQI, which houses the NACOR database, is protected by 2 firewalls within the American Society of Anesthesiologists' network infrastructure; this system has not been breached. The NACOR Participant User File, a deidentified case-level dataset of information from NACOR, is available to researchers at participating institutions. NACOR architecture and the nature of the Participant User File include both strengths and weaknesses."
Evaluation of fine particles in surgical smoke from an urologist's operating room by time and by distance.,"Electrocautery, harmonic scalpel tissue dissection and other surgical techniques can generate surgical smoke with high proportion of 'fine particles' (PM(2.5)) <2.5 μm, which is known to have adverse effects on human health. The high-risk zone for PM(2.5) during surgeries by time and by distance has not been well evaluated. The study included open superficial, open abdominal, open pelvic, laparoscopic and transurethral urology surgeries, five of each. A particle counter was placed at three different distances from the incision site, and the real-time PM(2.5) concentration was displayed after each cut. Air Quality Index (AQI) revised by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the calculated inhalation dose were used to evaluate the severity of PM(2.5). In superficial, abdominal and pelvic surgeries, the peak PM(2.5) concentration may reach 245.7, 149.4 and 165.1 μg/m(3) 3-6 s after a single cut 40 cm from the incision site. By the time, AQI usually turns to 'unhealthy' or 'very unhealthy.' In laparoscopic surgeries, 40 cm from the trocar, the air quality reached 'hazardous' in 3 s after opening of the trocar valve with a peak concentration of 517.5 μg/m(3). In transurethral surgeries, the AQI 40 cm away from the resectoscope is generally at moderate level. In each surgery, the chief surgeon may inhale most of the PM(2.5), while the assistant will inhale less than half the dose, and the scrub nurse may inhale nearly none. The use of wall suction may induce a 48-65 % decrease in fine particle inhalation. During surgeries, the concentration of PM(2.5) could reach a very unhealthy status, especially for the chief surgeon who is the nearest to the incision site. Surgical smoke evacuation in the first few seconds of a cut is essential; however, using smoke evacuators such as a wall suction alone may not be enough."
Assessment of Effects of Air Pollution on Daily Outpatient Visits using the Air Quality Index.,"The air quality index (AQI) is widely used to characterize the quality of ambient air. Chinese cities officially report the AQI on a daily basis. To assess the possible effects of air pollution on daily outpatient visits, we examined the association between AQI and the daily outpatient count. Daily data on outpatient visits to each clinical department were collected from the Z county hospital of Datong City, China. The collection period was between 5 April and 30 June, 2012. Daily AQI data and meteorological information were simultaneously recorded. We compared outpatient counts between the index days and comparison days, and calculated Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient between outpatient counts and AQI levels. The average AQI level for index days was significantly higher than that for comparison days. No significant difference was observed in temperature or relative humidity between index days and comparison days. The outpatient counts for pediatrics were significantly higher on index days than on comparison days, and no significant difference was noted in other clinical departments. The outpatient counts for pediatrics positively correlated with the AQI level, and no correlation was noted in other clinical departments. The present study assessed the association between daily outpatient visits and air pollution using AQI. The results obtained suggest that air pollution could increase the outpatient count for pediatrics."
"Influence of hazy weather on patient presentation with respiratory diseases in Beijing, China.","Chronic respiratory disease is an important factor for development of lung cancer. To explore the influence of hazy weather on respiratory diseases and its variation the present study was conducted. Data from air pollution surveillance from January to October 2014 and case records of visiting patients in the 263th Hospital of Chinese PLA in the corresponding period were collected to analyze the relevance between different degrees of air pollution (hazy weather) and the number of visiting patients in Department of Respiratory Disease. Air quality index (AQI) of hazy weather had significantly positive association with particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) and the number of patients with 5 kinds of respiratory diseases i and different pollutants had distinct influences on various respiratory diseases. The degree of air pollution in Beijing City is in close association with the number of patients with respiratory diseases, in which PM2.5 and SO2 are in more significant influences on all respiratory diseases. This could have essential implications for lung cancer development in China."
"Uncontrolled combustion of shredded tires in a landfill -Part 2: Population exposure, public health response, and an air quality index for urban fires.","The Iowa City Landfill in eastern Iowa, United States, experienced a fire lasting 18 days in 2012, in which a drainage layer of over 1 million shredded tires burned, generating smoke that impacted the surrounding metropolitan area of 130,000 people.

This paper quantifies the impact of the fire on local air quality and proposes a monitoring approach and an Air Quality Index (AQI) for use in future tire fires and other urban fires. Individual fire pollutants are ranked for acute and cancer relative risks using hazard ratios, with the highest acute hazard ratios attributed to SO"
Geographic distribution and epidemiology of lung cancer during 2011 in Zhejiang province of China.,"To explore etiology for providing scientific clues for the prevention of lung cancer. Data for lung cancer incidence and meteorological geographic factors from 25 counties in Zhejiang province of China during 2011 were studied. Stepwise multiple regression and correlation analysis were performed to analyze the geographic distribution and epidemiology of lung cancer. 8,291 new cases (5,998 in males and 2,293 females) of lung cancer during 2011 in Zhejiang province were reported in the 25 studied counties. Reported and standardized incidence rates for lung cancer were 58.0 and 47.0 per 100,000 population, respectively. The incidence of lung cancer increased with age. Geographic distribution analysis shows that the standardized incidence rates of lung cancer in northeastern Zhejiang province were higher than in the southwestern part, such as in Nanhu, Fuyang, Wuxing and Yuyao counties, where the rates were more than 50 per 100,000 population. In the southwestern Zhejiang province, for instance, in Yueqing, Xianju and Jiande counties, the standardized incidence rates of lung cancer were lower than 37 per 100,000 population. Spearman correlation tests showed that forest coverage rate, air quality index (AQI), and annual precipitation level are associated with the incidence of lung cancer. Lung cancer in Zhejiang province shows obvious regional differences. High incidence appears associated with low forest coverage rate, poor air quality and low annual precipitation. Therefore, increasing the forest coverage rate and controlling air pollution may play an important role in lung cancer prevention."
Daily mortality and air pollution in Atlanta: two years of data from ARIES.,"Associations between daily mortality and air pollution were investigated in Fulton and DeKalb Counties, Georgia, for the 2-yr period beginning in August 1998, as part of the Aerosol Research and Inhalation Epidemiological Study (ARIES). Mortality data were obtained directly from county offices of vital records. Air quality data were obtained from a dedicated research site in central Atlanta; 15 separate air quality indicators (AQIs) were selected from the 70 particulate and gaseous air quality parameters archived in the ARIES ambient air quality database. Daily meteorological parameters, comprising 24-h average temperatures and dewpoints, were obtained from Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport. Effects were estimated using Poisson regression with daily deaths as the response variable and time, meteorology, AQI, and days of the week as predictor variables. AQI variables entered the model in a linear fashion, while all other continuous predictor variables were smoothed via natural cubic splines using the generalized linear model (GLM) framework in S-PLUS. Knots were spaced either quarterly, monthly, or biweekly for temporal smoothing. A default model using monthly knots and AQIs averaged for lags 0 and 1 was postulated, with other models considered in sensitivity analyses. Lags up to 5 days were considered, and multipollutant models were evaluated, taking care to avoid overlapping (and thus collinear) AQIs. For this reason, PM(2.5) was partitioned into its three major constituents: SO(2-)(4), carbon (EC + 1.4 OC), and the remainder; sulfate was assumed to be (NH(4))(2)SO(4) for this purpose. Initial AQI screening was based on all-cause (ICD-9 codes <800) mortality for those aged 65 and over. For the (apparently) most important pollutants--PM(2.5) and its 3 major constituents, coarse PM mass [CM], 1-h maximum CO, 8-h maximum O(3)--we investigated 15 mortality categories in detail. (The 15 categories result from three age groups [all ages, <65, 65+] and five cause-of-death groups [all disease causes, cardiovascular, respiratory, cancer, and other ""remainder"" disease causes]). The GLM model outputs that were considered included mean AQI effects and their standard errors, and two indicators of relative model performance (deviance and deviance adjusted for the number of observations and model parameters). The latter indicator was considered to account for variations in the number of observations created by varying amounts of missing AQI data, which were not imputed. The single-AQI screening regressions on all-cause 65+ mortality show that CO, NO(2), PM(2.5), CM, SO(2), and O(3), followed by EC and OC, consistently have the best model fits, after adjusting for the number of observations. Their relative rankings, however, vary according to the smoothing knots used, and there is no correspondence between mean AQI effect and overall model fit.(Other regression runs often show that the best model fits are obtained with no AQI in the model.) There is no correspondence between mean AQI effect and statistical significance or between mean effect and serial correlation. There is a highly significant (.001 level) relationship between overall model fit and serial correlation; the best fitting models have the most frequent knot spacing and the most negative serial correlation. The regression analyses by cause of death find elderly circulatory deaths to be consistently associated with CO for all models."
Metabolism of 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide by rat liver microsomes.,"4'-(9-Acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide (m-AMSA) is metabolized by a hepatic microsomal enzyme system composed of rat liver microsomes, a reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-generating system, cytosolic protein (or glutathione), and oxygen. Omission of any one of the components, or incubation under an atmosphere of CO or N2, results in inhibition of the reaction. Also, the addition of inhibitors of microsomal metabolism (alpha-naphthoflavone, metyrapone, or SKF 525-A) decreases m-AMSA metabolism. Metabolism of m-AMSA is more rapid with microsomes prepared from rats pretreated with phenobarbital or 3-methylcholanthrene. Two microsomal oxidation products of m-AMSA were isolated and identified as N1'-methanesulfonyl-N4'-(9-acridinyl)-3'-methoxy-2',5'-cyclohex adiene-1', 4'-dimine (m-AQDI) and 3'-methoxy-4'-(9-acridinylamino-2',5'-cyclohexadien-1'-one (m-AQI). m-AQDI reacts with glutathione to form a product previously identified in in vivo studies as the principal rat biliary metabolite and which is not cytotoxic to cultured L1210 cells. Thus, the end result of the microsomal metabolism of m-AMSA is detoxification. However, the two primary oxidation products (m-AQDI and m-AQI) are considerably more cytotoxic to L1210 cells in vitro than is m-AMSA. The concentration of m-AMSA required to produce a 5-log kill is 1.0 microgram/ml compared to 0.01 microgram/ml for m-AQDI and m-AQI. These results indicate that m-AMSA might undergo bioactivation to form the active cytotoxic species of the drug."
Particulate matter levels and children's lung function in a rural cohort near a drying saline lake.,"The drying Salton Sea in California is a growing source of wind-blown dust, raising particulate matter (PM) levels in surrounding areas. The impacts of these exposures on children's lung function remain poorly understood. We examined the relationship between PM levels and lung function in children near the Salton Sea. We enrolled 491 children (mean age: 10.2 years), who were followed over ~1.5 years, contributing 1,269 lung function assessments. Forced expiratory volume in the first second of exhalation (FEV Each 1 µg/m³ increase in average PM PM exposure near the Salton Sea is related to reduced lung function of pediatric residents."

Association between subway iron particulate matter exposure and respiratory disease in New York City.,"Particulate matter exposure is linked to increased morbidity and mortality. Iron-rich particulate matter (PM2.5), common in rapid transit systems, is a potential but understudied contributor to respiratory illness. Using electronic health records (EHR) from 452,272 patients in the INSIGHT Clinical Research Network in New York City (2020-2023), we examined whether local iron exposure is associated with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), breathing difficulties, or respiratory inhaler use. Iron exposure was estimated using particulate matter measurements from New York City (NYC) subway stations, linked to each patients residential census block group. To account for potential non-linear relationships, we applied linear probability models and an adjacent block group estimator with paired fixed effects to assess respiratory outcomes across deciles of iron exposure. We found that the relative risk of developing asthma, COPD, or breathing difficulties increased by 6-15% between the lowest two exposure deciles. Beyond this range, there was no significant association between iron exposure and respiratory disease. This suggests that iron exposure from rapid transit is associated with respiratory disease primarily at lower exposure levels, with limited health benefits from marginal reductions in iron exposure at already high exposure levels."

"""You Feel Empowered"": Parents' Emotional Responses to Air Pollution Sensing at Home.","Citizen science with particulate matter sensors at home increases awareness of pollution exposures and can inform health-protective actions, yet little research explores the emotional dimensions of sensing, especially across economic divides. This study shows that participatory air quality sensing is not emotionally neutral. We included 26 parents of asthmatic children in 10 weeks of participatory sensing with indoor and outdoor sensors to understand their exposure experiences. Drawing from weekly surveys and postproject interviews, we found that sensors often generated positive emotions (e.g., empowered, happy) across income levels, underscoring their potential as inclusive tools for asthma management. Parents less often reported negative emotions (e.g., stress, worry); when they did, those were spurred from checking outdoor readings (versus indoor) because outdoor exposures were less controllable. Parents managed emotions by creating contingent boundaries between indoor and outdoor spaces. We recommend expanding access to sensors and air purifiers to promote individual-level environmental health benefits."

Unravelling the exposome of severe exacerbations of obstructive respiratory diseases in France.,"Understanding the influence of environmental and socioeconomic factors, collectively known as the exposome, on severe exacerbation risks in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma is crucial for enhancing patient care. We assessed the impact of the exposome on COPD and asthma severe exacerbations in France between 2018 and 2022, combining data from the French National Hospital Discharge Programme de Médicalisation des Systèmes d'Information database and open data for multiple environmental exposition. Using a retrospective matched case-control design, 473 990 patients with COPD and 187 332 patients with asthma were matched for sex, birth year and date of first hospitalisation. Conditional logistic regressions were performed to quantify ORs of exacerbations within the studied population.

Early-Onset Wheeze Trajectories in Infants: The Phenotyping of Wheezing Infants (P-WIN) Study.,"Recurrent wheeze in infancy is common; although symptoms often resolve, some children develop persistent disease. To better capture clinical heterogeneity, we analyzed wheeze trajectories based on symptom frequency rather than simply recording presence or absence. To identify distinct wheeze phenotypes in 1-year-old children with recurrent wheeze by modeling longitudinal wheezing frequency trajectories. We conducted a 2-year, multicenter prospective cohort study involving children aged 12-23 months with recurrent wheeze at 27 sites in Japan. Monthly caregiver-reported wheeze frequency was collected, and trajectories were classified using latent class growth analysis. Clinical characteristics, environmental exposures, and biomarkers were assessed at enrollment and age 3. Ordinal and binary logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk and protective factors. Among 253 enrolled children, 219 completed follow-up. Four trajectories were identified: Early-Resolving (24.2%), Low-Frequency with Mid-Peak (57.1%), Persistent High-Frequency (12.8%), and Late-Peaking High-Frequency (5.9%). The latter two groups showed greater symptom burden, including more frequent corticosteroid use and interference with daily activities. Ordinal logistic regression showed that parental allergic rhinitis and pet ownership were associated with lower odds of more severe trajectories. Binary logistic regression comparing high- (Clusters 3-4) versus low-frequency (Clusters 1-2) groups revealed parental smoking as a strong risk factor (OR 5.49), while allergic rhinitis (OR 0.12) and pet ownership (OR 0.11) remained protective. High-frequency wheeze trajectories were linked to greater clinical burden. Early identification of at-risk children and targeted environmental interventions-particularly avoidance of passive smoking-may reduce morbidity in early-onset recurrent wheeze."

"What do the clinical and respiratory functional assessments of woodworkers in Parakou, West Africa, reveal?","The prevalence of chronic respiratory diseases is increasing globally. Apart from smoking, other contributing factors include occupational exposures, of which wood dust is thought to play a role. This study aimed to investigate relationships between respiratory symptoms or lung function measurements and exposure to wood dust. This was a prospective and comparative cross-sectional study carried out at Parakou, between June and September 2024. Overall, 108 woodworkers (exposed group) and 108 administrative agents from the city hall, the court and five selected banks (control group) were included. Data were collected on upper and lower respiratory symptoms persisting for at least one week in the last 12 months, demographic and occupational-related characteristics, comorbidities, lifestyles, followed by particulate matter  measurements in the workplace and spirometry testing. The mean ages of participants in exposed and control groups were 40±11 and 38±9 years-old, respectively (p=0.163). All were males. Seniority in the profession was longer in the exposed group (18±12 years vs 8±6 years; p<0.001). Workplace ventilation was found inadequate in the exposed group (27% vs 0%; p<0.001). In carpentry, Milicia excelsa (66%) and Afzelia africana (64%) were the types of wood most commonly used. Mean dust levels for PM10, PM2.5 and PM1.0 were 1.4±0.6 mg/m3, 1.2±0.6 mg/m3 and 1.2±0.6 mg/m3, respectively. Cleaning and protection methods for woodworkers included dry sweeping (61%), dust collection devices (7%), personal homemade face-masks (99%), and affiliation to company insurance schemes (12%).No worker had planned check-ups arranged with an occupational physician. Both respiratory symptoms (94% vs 56%; p<0.001) and work-related respiratory symptoms (92% vs 19%; p<0.001) were more common in the exposed versus control group. Exposure to wood dust (aPR=6.8; 95%CI=4.1-11.4; p<0.001) and asthma (aPR=5.4; 95%CI=2.9-10.1; p<0.001) were significantly associated with respiratory symptoms, after adjustment for biomass and passive smoking exposure and length in the profession. The exposed group had a higher prevalence of restrictive disorder suggestive pattern on spirometry than the control group (48% vs 20%; p<0.001). Exposure to wood dust adversely affects respiratory function in woodworkers at Parakou, hence the need to raise awareness among these professionals and identify ways to improve their working conditions."
PM2.5 exposure exacerbates airway pyroptosis related inflammatory response in asthmatic mice by activating NLRP3 inflammasome.,"Fine particulate matter (PM2.5)-induced airway epithelial damage plays a pivotal role in driving the development of airway inflammation. Although pyroptosis is recognized for its highly proinflammatory nature, its precise role in PM2.5-associated airway inflammation, particularly in asthmatic condition, remains to be fully elucidated. In ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized asthmatic mice, we assessed pulmonary histopathology, inflammatory cell counts and Th2 cytokine levels (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and airway epithelial pyroptosis. To investigate the effects of PM2.5 on airway epithelial cells, BEAS-2B cells were exposed to PM2.5. Cell viability was evaluated using the CCK-8 assay, while pyroptosis-related protein levels and inflammatory cytokine release were analyzed by Western blot and ELISA, respectively. Additionally, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to examine PM2.5-induced ultrastructural changes in BEAS-2B cells. To further elucidate the underlying mechanism, we administered the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 and the Caspase-1 inhibitor Ac-YVAD-cmk to verify the involvement of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in PM2.5-exposed asthmatic mice. PM2.5 exposure significantly aggravated airway inflammation in asthmatic mice, as demonstrated by elevated histopathological inflammatory scores in lung tissues and increased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in BALF. Furthermore, PM2.5 upregulated the abundance of pyroptosis-related markers, namely NLRP3, Caspase-1, GSDMD, and IL-1β, in the lung tissues of asthmatic mice. In BEAS-2B cells, PM2.5 exposure led to a dose-dependent reduction in cell viability and promoted the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, subsequently leading to Caspase-1-mediated GSDMD cleavage and IL-1β secretion. TEM further confirmed pyroptosis, revealing characteristic morphological alterations such as cytoplasmic vacuolation, mitochondrial swelling, and plasma membrane pore formation in BEAS-2B cells exposed to PM2.5. Critically, inhibition of NLRP3 (MCC950) or Caspase-1 (Ac-YVAD-cmk) markedly attenuated PM2.5-induced pyroptosis and ameliorated airway inflammation in asthmatic mice, underscoring the pivotal role of the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD axis in this pathogenic process. Our findings demonstrate that PM2.5 exposure induces airway epithelial pyroptosis through NLRP3 inflammasome activation, thereby exacerbating airway inflammation in asthmatic mice."

Nine hay fever symptom scores and quality of life (QoL) scores were compared among the groups. Multivariate analysis evaluated independent associations between pollen and PM2.5/yellow dust dispersion levels and hay fever symptom and QoL scores. Risk factors for individuals experiencing worsening hay fever symptoms during PM2.5/yellow dust dispersion were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis. This analysis included 6468 participants. All hay fever symptom scores except ""ear and/or mouth itching,"" and all QoL scores were significantly higher in the ""low pollen and moderate-to-high PM2.5/yellow dust"" group versus the ""low pollen and low PM2.5/yellow dust"" group. PM2.5/yellow dust levels independently associated with worsening of hay fever symptom and QoL scores, except for ""ear and/or mouth itching."" Being a woman (P = 0.010), a history of atopic dermatitis (P = 0.013), bronchial asthma (P = 0.046), dry eye disease (P = 0.048), oral medication (P = 0.009) and air purifier use (P = 0.043) were significant risk factors for worsening hay fever symptoms during PM2.5/yellow dust dispersion. Our findings suggest that PM2.5 and yellow dust exacerbated hay fever symptoms independent of pollen exposure, with distinct symptom profiles."

Spatiotemporal patterns of asthma in Bhutan: a Bayesian analysis.,"Asthma is a chronic respiratory disorder requiring ongoing medical management. This ecological study investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of notification rates for asthma from clinic visits and hospital discharges and identified demographic, meteorological and environmental factors that drive asthma in Bhutan. Monthly numbers of asthma notifications from 2016 to 2022 were obtained from the Bhutan Ministry of Health. Climatic variables (rainfall, relative humidity, minimum and maximum temperature) were obtained from the National Centre for Hydrology and Meteorology, Bhutan. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and surface particulate matter (PM2.5) were extracted from open sources. A multivariable zero-inflated Poisson regression (ZIP) model was developed in a Bayesian framework to quantify the relationship between risk of asthma and sociodemographic and environmental correlates, while also identifying the underlying spatial structure of the data. There were 12 696 asthma notifications, with an annual average prevalence of 244/100 000 population between 2016 and 2022. In ZIP analysis, asthma notifications were 3.4 times (relative risk (RR)=3.39; 95% credible interval (CrI) 3.047 to 3.773) more likely in individuals aged >14 years than those aged ≤14 years, and 43% (RR=1.43; 95% CrI 36.5% to 49.2%) more likely for females than males. Asthma notification increased by 0.8% (RR=1.008, 95% CrI 0.2% to 1.5%) for every 10 cm increase in rainfall, and 1.7% (RR=1.017; 95% CrI 1.2% to 2.3%) for a 1°C increase in maximum temperature. An increase in one unit of NDVI and 10 µg/m Environmental risk factors and spatial clusters of asthma notifications were identified. Identification of spatial clusters and environmental risk factors can help develop targeted interventions that maximise impact of limited public health resources for controlling asthma in Bhutan."
Allergic Sensitization Worsens Respiratory Health in Children With Asthma During Dust and Pollen Periods.,"The Eastern Mediterranean has climatic conditions that increase exposure to aeroallergens due to higher pollen counts and dust storms. The association of atopy with measures of respiratory health, including fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and pulmonary function among asthmatic children during dust and pollen periods has not been assessed. Examine the association between allergic sensitization and respiratory health in children with asthma during dust and pollen seasons in the Eastern Mediterranean. We conducted an analysis of prospectively collected respiratory health data from schoolchildren with asthma in Cyprus and Crete-Greece during spring and fall of 2019 and 2021. Children were assessed 3 to 4 times over 4 months, including evaluation of allergic sensitization by skin prick tests (SPTs). Mixed effect models were applied, adjusting for potential confounders, including study year, location, weeks on study, age and sex. There were 131 children included (77 atopic and 54 non-atopic; mean (SD) age = 9.5 (1.6) years; 65% boys). Over the study period, atopic children exhibited 113.71% (95% CI: 68.08%, 171.73%) higher FeNO concentrations and reduced FEV Atopic children with asthma may experience greater morbidity compared to non-atopic children during dust and pollen periods. Given the long-range transport of desert dust, clinicians both within and beyond the Eastern Mediterranean should be aware of this health concern."
Urban Sprawl and Asthma: Exploring the Role of Green Space and Air Pollution as Mediators.,"Rapid urbanization in China has reshaped urban spatial form with potential consequences for respiratory health. We examined the association between the Urban Sprawl Index (USI) - where higher values indicate a more dispersed, less compact urban form - and asthma and quantified mediation via ambient air pollution and park green space. We analyzed 11,043 respondents from the 2015 wave of the nationally representative China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Asthma was based on a self-reported physician diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression estimated the association between USI and asthma using quartiles and restricted cubic splines; models adjusted for sociodemographic, behavioral, and health covariates. We conducted subgroup analyses and performed causal mediation with nonparametric bootstrapping (5,000 resamples) to estimate the average causal mediation effect (ACME), average direct effect (ADE), and proportion mediated for particulate matter ≤2.5 µm (PM Higher USI was associated with greater odds of asthma. An interquartile-range increase in USI was associated with a 15.1% increase in the odds of asthma (OR = 1.151; 95% CI: 1.034-1.282; p = 0.010), with a clear dose-response across USI quartiles and a monotonic pattern in spline analyses. Associations varied by marital status and education (p for interaction < 0.05). In mediation analyses, ∼7-12% of the total effect was mediated - ∼11.7% via park green space and ∼7.5% via PM More dispersed, sprawling urban form is associated with higher asthma, partly mediated by reduced park green space and increased PM"
Wildfire smoke and pediatric asthma control in the Northeastern United States: a cross-sectional study.,"Poor air quality due to smoke from distant wildfires is a growing risk for the Northeastern United States, a region largely unaffected by these events until recently. Despite this emerging threat, few studies have examined the effect of wildfire smoke on respiratory health in this region. We investigated the association between wildfire smoke exposure and pediatric asthma control in Vermont and upstate New York. We extracted data from the electronic health records of youth aged 3-21 years diagnosed with asthma within a single regional healthcare system and included three clinical measures of asthma control: Test for Respiratory and Asthma Control in Kids (3-4 years), Asthma Therapy Assessment Questionnaire (5-21 years), and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) asthma control guidelines (3-21 years). We first compared asthma control in the smoke-affected summer of 2023 to the largely unaffected summers of 2022 and 2024 using regression models, controlling for pollen exposure. We then obtained airborne particulate matter (PM The study sample included 1,217 encounters (mean age 9.1 ± 4.4 years, 57% male). Asthma control was significantly worse in the severely smoke-affected summer of 2023 versus 2022 for two of the three clinical measures but was not different between 2023 and 2024 for any of the clinical measures. Within summer 2023, there were no significant associations between ZIP code-level PM Wildfire smoke exposure in the Northeast was associated with decreased asthma control in this pediatric population, though not consistently across years and all clinical measures. As climate change drives longer and more intense wildfire seasons, continued monitoring is needed to understand the impact on pediatric respiratory health in this historically low-exposed region."
"Facemask and respirator use for bushfire smoke protection: A cross-country comparison of public health policies in Australia, Canada, India, and the United States.","As climate change intensifies the frequency and severity of bushfires, exposure to bushfire smoke is emerging as a significant public health concern, associated with numerous adverse health outcomes, including exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory infections. This study examined policies related to the use of masks and respirators as protective measures against smoke exposure. Policies and guidelines of health departments, emergency and fire services, and other relevant organisations of selected countries were reviewed. Guidelines were sourced from organizational websites, PubMed, and Google Scholar using specific keywords. There is variability in policies regarding mask and respirator use during bushfires. Health departments generally recommend using P2/ N95 respirators to protect the public from particulate exposure arising bushfire smoke, while emergency and fire services generally recommend surgical or cloth masks. Few guidelines provided detailed instructions on the proper use of respirators, including fit testing, or fit checking procedures. Most guidelines emphasised monitoring air quality and avoiding bushfire smoke, particularly for high-risk groups. There is no guidance provided on the length of time a mask should be used in any guideline. The inconsistent recommendations from health organisations and countries regarding mask and respirator use during bushfires highlights the lack of high-quality evidence in this area. Health, emergency and fire services, and other relevant organisations should provide clear guidance around types of facemasks, the length of time a facemask should be used and on proper use of respirators use, including training and fit checking."
Study on the health impacts of childhood asthma in China caused by air pollution.,"Asthma is one of the major disease burdens in children. Ambient air pollution is associated with the prevalence and exacerbation of childhood asthma. Over recent decades, China has exhibited a persistent upward trajectory in pediatric asthma prevalence. This epidemiological trend necessitates a comprehensive evaluation of the health impacts associated with childhood asthma attributable to ambient air pollution exposure. This study selected PM2.5, NO2, and O3 as representative ambient air pollutants in China, and obtained exposure-response parameters required for health impact assessment through Meta-analysis. Then the study evaluated the health impacts of childhood asthma aged 0-14 years attributable to air pollution in 336 cities across China based on national real-time air quality monitoring data. Hypothetical scenarios were also constructed to predict the preventable childhood asthma disease burden under different air pollution control levels. The results showed that in 2019, air pollution caused 264,800-467,100 childhood asthma exacerbation cases and 622,800-1115,000 incident asthma cases among children, accounting for 7.1% - 12.5% and 31.4% - 56.2% of the total asthma children visits and incidence of childhood asthma in that year. The pollutant that has the greatest impact on childhood asthma is O3, followed by PM2.5 and NO2. The health impacts of the three pollutants were spatially distributed to be higher in the central and southern regions of China, and lower in the southwestern, northeastern, and northwestern regions. Chongqing was the city most affected by three types of pollutants. When pollutant concentrations comply with the WHO guidelines, up to 267,900 cases of childhood asthma exacerbations and 873,900 new-onset childhood asthma cases could be averted."
Inflammatory and Immune Effects of Pollution: Comparison Between Patients With Asthma and Healthy Individuals.,"The objective of this study was to assess inflammatory and immune responses in patients with asthma and healthy controls exposed to a polluted and a nonpolluted environment over a short period. We performed a randomized crossover study in patients with asthma (n=20) and in healthy controls (n=15). Participants were exposed for 2 hours to a polluted environment and, after 14 days, to a nonpolluted environment. Pollution levels were assessed at each exposure. Subsequently, serum levels of 8-isoprostane and glutathione peroxidase were measured as markers of oxidative stress, as were 48 cytokines involved in inflammation and the immune response. In the polluted environment, significantly higher levels of PM1, PM10, NO2, NO, and CO were observed (P=.0026, .0337, <.0001, <.0001, and .0004, respectively) than in the nonpolluted environment. After exposure to a polluted environment, both groups (healthy controls and asthma patients) presented higher values of IL-17F (P=.0285 and .0348, respectively) and CSF2 (P=.0425 and 0.0305, respectively). After exposure to high levels of pollution, healthy controls presented reductions in glutathione peroxidase (with antioxidant activity), CSF3, HGF, and OSM (P=.0038, P=.0123, 0.0353, and 0.0256, respectively) and increased levels of IL-7, CXCL8, and CCL2 (P=.0015, 0.0119 and 0.0215, respectively). Asthma patients had higher serum levels of IL-1ß and IL-15 (P=.0232 and 0.0497, respectively). Healthy individuals and asthma patients respond differently to exposure to pollutants. Healthy individuals are characterized by adaptive suppression of immune activity, whereas asthma patients present a more marked inflammatory response."
Air pollution and health of working-age population: Evidence from thermal inversion.,"Despite the significant impact of air pollution on public health, its causal effects on a national scale have not been extensively studied. In this paper, we examine the impact of PM2.5 on adult health in the United States using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System for 2001-2012, focusing on a period of relatively low pollution levels. To address the endogeneity issue, we use the two-stage least squares regression with thermal inversion as an instrumental variable. Our findings provide evidence of the ongoing negative impact of air pollution on overall health. In particular, we find that a 1 µg/m"
Occupational airborne exposures and asthma mortality - examining asthma as the underlying and contributing cause of death.,"The aim was to elucidate whether occupational airborne exposures increases asthma mortality. The study comprised men in the Swedish construction industry who participated in health controls in 1971-1993. Exposure was assessed using a job-exposure matrix with focus on exposures in the mid-1970s. Mortality from asthma in 1987-2015 was compared between 147,101 workers exposed to occupational airborne exposures and 26,879 foremen, using underlying and contributory cause of death from the Swedish Cause of Death Register. Mortality was assessed as relative risk with 95% confidence intervals using Poisson regression models adjusting for age, smoking, body mass index, and calendar time. Among exposed workers, there were 82 deaths with asthma as the underlying cause and 212 deaths with asthma as the contributory cause vs. ten and 21 deaths in the controls. The asthma mortality based on the underlying and contributory cause was 1.92 (1.31-2.83) in relation to inorganic dust, 2.17 (1.47-3.20) in relation to fumes, 1.60 (1.04-2.47) in relation to gases, and 1.79 (1.09-2.96) in relation to wood dust. Using only the underlying cause of death showed similar mortality estimates, but with wider confidence intervals including unity. Occupational airborne exposures increased the asthma mortality, underscoring the need for further reduction of the airborne occupational exposures. Workers with asthma should be given information about the effects of exposure and support to decrease exposure. The study shows the importance of using both contributing and underlying cause of death in studies assessing asthma mortality risk in relation to air pollutants."
Exposure to environmental xenobiotics and lung tissue function: A comprehensive review on biological mechanisms and pathways.,"Environmental xenobiotics, encompassing a wide spectrum of chemical pollutants such as particulate matter-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), persistent organic pollutants (POPs), heavy metals, endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), pesticides, and emerging contaminants like nanomaterials and microplastics, have been increasingly implicated in impairing lung tissue function. These agents enter the body primarily through inhalation, particularly via outdoor air pollution, indoor contaminants, and occupational exposures, with additional contributions from ingestion and dermal absorption. Studies investigating these pollutants employ diverse exposure assessment methods, including environmental and biological monitoring, model-based estimations, and questionnaire-based tools. Lung function assessment spans from clinical spirometry and imaging to experimental histopathology and molecular biomarker analyses. Mechanistic evidence reveals that xenobiotics induce lung injury through oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, epithelial barrier disruption, and epigenetic alterations. These processes lead to chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis, and lung cancer. Key signaling pathways implicated include activation of NF-κB, AP-1, and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), promoting pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic responses. Furthermore, pollutant-induced epithelial permeability and fibrotic remodeling via TGF-β signaling exacerbate lung tissue damage and functional decline. While spirometry is widely used in population studies, it lacks sensitivity for early pathophysiological changes, necessitating integration with molecular and imaging approaches. Experimental models and in vitro studies provide valuable mechanistic insight, though challenges remain in translating findings to human populations. Current research underscores the complexity of real-world exposure scenarios and highlights the need for harmonized, multidisciplinary approaches combining environmental, biological, and molecular data. This comprehensive review synthesizes evidence across epidemiological and experimental studies, aiming to elucidate the biological pathways by which xenobiotic exposure compromises lung tissue function and to inform future research and regulatory strategies."
Climate Change and Air Pollution-Related Health Effects on Pain.,"Climate change-related weather extremes and air pollution have wide-ranging health effects, with emerging evidence suggesting a potential influence on pain. This narrative review explores the relationship between climate-related weather parameters/air pollution with pain across various conditions, including chronic and acute musculoskeletal pain, postoperative pain, headache/migraine, dysmenorrhea, and chest pain. Included studies were published in 2014 or later. Findings indicate that higher humidity/dampness may exacerbate pain in individuals with knee osteoarthritis, while extremes in temperature and humidity are linked to a higher risk of gout arthritis attacks. No clinically meaningful associations were found between weather parameters and acute low-back pain. However, lower barometric pressure, elevated temperatures, and possibly higher humidity may influence postoperative pain levels. Headache and migraine episodes were more frequent during heat waves and periods of high humidity or rainfall, as well as in areas with elevated traffic-related air pollutants and particulate matter. Air pollution exposure was also associated with increased risk of dysmenorrhea, while lower temperatures and higher humidity correlated with more severe menstrual cramps. Temperature extremes were linked to chest pain in patients with asthma and other conditions. Overall, this review highlights the disproportionate pain-related burden of climate change and air pollution on women and emphasizes the need for further research."
"Dust air pollution and hospital visits for respiratory, cardiovascular, and eye diseases in Eastern Iran.","One of the most significant environmental concerns that has been spreading in recent years due to human interference and irrational use of natural resources is the phenomenon of dust. This study investigated the relationship between dust air pollution and the burden of daily hospital visits due to respiratory, cardiovascular, and eye diseases. In this cross-sectional study, data on dust air pollution were collected from the Environment office and data on daily visits to hospitals from the hospital information system (HIS) through a checklist. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 22 software and Pearson correlation coefficient at a significance level of < 0.05. The average dust air pollution index in the studied area was 2233.71 ± 4737.52 µg/m³. The mean number of hospital visits for various conditions were as follows: pneumonia, 63.76 ± 84.72; eye diseases, 46.8 ± 70.2; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 62.5 ± 83.3; asthma, 64.7 ± 87.0; dyspnea, 63.8 ± 90.8; and cardiovascular diseases, 56.5 ± 66.2 patients. A significant moderate positive linear correlation was found between dust air pollution levels and daily hospital visits for pneumonia, dyspnea, COPD, asthma, eye diseases, and cardiovascular diseases (p < 0.0001). As air pollution increased, the number of hospital visits for these conditions also rose. The strongest correlation was observed between dust air pollution and dyspnea (r = 0.497), while the weakest correlation was found between dust air pollution and eye diseases (r = 0.406). Exposure to dust air pollution was correlated with hospital admissions for respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia, asthma, and COPD, as well as cardiovascular diseases and eye issues. It seems that using personal protection strategies by habitants to reduce dust exposure and implementation of long-term strategies by policymakers for controlling dust air pollution especially dust controlling for this region are necessary."
Distinct DNA methylation in mother-infant dyads exposed to PM2.5 in pregnancy.,"Air pollution exposure during pregnancy increases the risk of allergic and respiratory diseases, yet its epigenetic effects across the maternal-fetal interface remain poorly understood. We conducted a pilot study of 10 mother-infant dyads near Fresno, California, to investigate whether prenatal air pollution exposure is associated with differential DNA methylation (DNAm) in maternal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and infant cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs). Using a custom DNAm array targeting high-value allergy- and asthma-associated loci, we identified 24 CpG sites in maternal PBMCs and 18 in infant CBMCs associated with PM2.5 exposure. Only one CpG site was shared between PBMCs and CBMCs, suggesting largely distinct DNAm responses to PM2.5 in maternal and fetal circulations. Further research is needed to validate these associations and determine their functional implications for immune development and disease risk."
Long-term exposure to black carbon and incident asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults: The Danish Nurse Cohort.,"Air pollution is a known risk factor for chronic respiratory diseases, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, evidence regarding the role of black carbon (BC) remains mixed and sparse. This study aimed to examine the association of long-term exposure to air pollution, focusing on BC, with incident asthma and COPD in adults. We followed 28,731 female nurses from the Danish Nurse Cohort from baseline (1993/1999) until the end of 2018, tracking their first-ever hospital contact (inpatient, outpatient, or emergency visit) for asthma or COPD. Annual mean concentrations of BC, fine particulate matter (PM Over an average follow-up of 23 years, 633 nurses developed asthma, and 1145 developed COPD. We found long-term exposure to BC was consistently associated with increased risks of both asthma and COPD, with hazard ratios (HR) per 0.34 μg/m We observed that BC is an independent risk factor for developing chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma and COPD, and BC may play a more significant role than PM"

Evidence for Aerosolized Environmental Bacterial Endotoxin as an Environmental Health Hazard.,The high incidence of asthma near California's Salton Sea is attributed to dust emitted from the exposed lakebed. A survey of clinical symptoms conducted in the region revealed distinct spatial distribution with strong geospatial correlations between asthma symptoms and prevailing wind direction as well as with PM
Early Life Intervention in Paediatrics Supported by E-Health (ELIPSE)-a coaching app for parents to reduce obesity and second-hand smoke exposure in children: study protocols for two parallel-group randomised controlled trials.,"Family lifestyle factors-such as physical activity, diet and parental smoking-are key modifiable determinants for child health. Physical inactivity and calorie-dense diets contribute to obesity, which is linked to 75% of all non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure significantly increases the risk of respiratory NCDs in children, including asthma. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has proven effective in modifying harmful parental behaviours, but it remains unclear whether app-based CBT for parents can improve family behaviours and child health outcomes. The Early Life Intervention in Paediatrics Supported by E-Health (ELIPSE) project aims to implement and evaluate personalised, family-centred, guided e-health interventions delivered via the ELIPSE mobile app. In two randomized controlled trials (ELIPSE I and II), the ELIPSE app will deliver CBT elements, tailored thematic content, and personalised feedback, all remotely guided by a coach. In ELIPSE I, 148 parent-child dyads (child age 6-12 years, BMI > 97th percentile) are randomly assigned 1:1 to treatment as usual (TAU; control group) versus TAU plus full access to the activated ELIPSE app (intervention group). The primary endpoint is the change in children's ratio of total energy intake to total energy expenditure (TEI/TEE). Secondary endpoints include obesity severity and cardiometabolic risk factors. In ELIPSE II, 160 dyads of a smoking parent and child (< 6 years) are randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either a leaflet on protecting children from SHS exposure (control group) or access to the activated ELIPSE app (intervention group). The primary endpoint is the change in children's urinary cotinine levels. Secondary endpoints include parental measures to reduce SHS exposure. The intervention period for both trials is 20 weeks, with outcomes assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 48-week follow-up. The ELIPSE project offers a novel approach to addressing key modifiable NCD risk factors within the family environment, with the goal to improve long-term child health outcomes and reducing morbidity and healthcare costs. Unlike traditional care, the ELIPSE app overcomes time and space constraints, allowing continuous support and personalised guidance. Both trials prospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: ELIPSE I as NCT06208345 (15 January 2024); ELIPSE II as NCT06311162 (7 March 2024)."
Weight Trajectories Among Youths Following Residential Relocation.,"Overweight and obesity affect millions of children and adolescents worldwide, and its prevalence is increasing. To investigate the associations of changes in the surrounding residential environment following relocation on childhood body mass index (BMI), focusing on 3 external exposome domains: air pollution, the built environment, and socioeconomic disadvantage. This longitudinal cohort study used harmonized data from birth cohorts from the Netherlands (PIAMA), Sweden (BAMSE), and the Czech Republic (ELSPAC-CZ) participating in the EXPANSE (Exposome Powered Tools for Healthy Living in Urban Settings) project, with birth dates ranging between 1991 and 1997. Participants were youths aged 2 to 24 years who had experienced residential relocation during their follow-up. Analysis focused on within-individual changes resulting from relocation. k Means clustering characterized multiple exposures from the 3 external exposome domains. Fixed-effects linear models estimated associations of exposome changes with changes in age- and sex-standardized body mass index (z-BMI), adjusted for relevant covariates. This study was conducted between July 2023 and January 2025. Changes in 3 external exposome domains: (1) ambient air pollution from high-resolution surfaces; (2) the built environment, including green, blue, and gray spaces and light at night; and (3) area-level socioeconomic disadvantage indicators. Domain-specific exposome profiles were characterized as low-, medium-, and high-hazard environments. Changes in z-BMI. The study included 4359 participants (1467 from PIAMA, 1778 from BAMSE, and 1114 from ELSPAC-CZ). A total of 2215 (50.8%) were male. The mean (SD) age at inclusion was 3.0 (1.1) years, and mean (SD) age at moving was 7.7 (4.3) years. Parental education varied across cohorts. Mean (SD) z-BMI was 0.2 (1.1), 0.4 (1.0), and 0.1 (1.2) at baseline and 0.0 (1.0), 0.3 (1.0), and 0.1 (1.1) after moving in PIAMA, BAMSE, and ELSPAC-CZ, respectively. Moving to higher-hazard environments (more polluted, more gray space) was associated with increases in z-BMI for all domains in PIAMA; significant associations were also seen for some domains and exposures in BAMSE and ELSPAC-CZ. Specifically, an association between moving to a more built environment and increase in z-BMI was consistent across cohorts: an IQR increase in gray spaces was associated with increases of 0.04 (95% CI, 0.01-0.06) units and 0.05 (95% CI, 0.01-0.09) units in z-BMI in BAMSE and PIAMA, respectively. An IQR increase in air pollution hazard was associated with increases of 0.07 (95% CI, 0.02-0.12) units and 0.07 (95% CI, 0.01-0.14) units in z-BMI for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), respectively, in PIAMA. Presence of effect modification by parental education and age at moving varied across cohorts. In this multicountry cohort study of 4359 youths in the Netherlands, Sweden, and the Czech Republic, moving to greener, less urbanized environments was associated with healthy childhood BMI trajectories. Heterogeneity across cohorts highlighted the context-specific influence of external exposome domains on childhood weight."
Associations of serum cotinine with asthma risk in US children: a mediation analysis of body mass index.,"In recent years, the prevalence of asthma among children has increased, with tobacco smoke exposure identified as a major contributor. However, the effects of tobacco exposure on childhood asthma remain insufficiently investigated. This study aims to investigate the relationship between serum cotinine, a biomarker of tobacco exposure, and the risk of childhood asthma, and to explore whether body mass index (BMI) mediates this relationship. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2011 to 2018, this study analyzed serum cotinine, physician-diagnosed asthma and BMI in children aged 3-12 years. Weighted multivariable logistic regression models, subgroup analyses, smooth curve fitting, threshold effect analysis and mediation analysis were employed to examine the relationship between serum cotinine and asthma. The study found a nonlinear relationship between serum cotinine and asthma. The risk appeared to reach saturation when the Log2-serum cotinine value was -0.3 (equivalent to serum cotinine concentration of 0.81 ng/mL). Additionally, mediation analysis revealed that BMI accounts for approximately 12.21 % of the mediating effect in the relationship between serum cotinine and increased asthma risk. The present study indicates that elevated serum cotinine, a novel biomarker of tobacco exposure, are significantly associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma and that BMI plays a significant mediating role in this relationship."
Short-Term PM2.5 Exposure and Mortality in Older Adults with Asthma in South Korea.,"Despite growing concerns over the adverse health effects of air pollution, research on the mortality risk associated with exposure to fine particulate matter (PM) in older adults with asthma remains limited. This study aims to investigate the association between short-term exposure to PM2.5 and mortality risk among older adults with asthma. This study utilized the National Health Insurance Service database in South Korea and included 139,189 individuals aged 65 and older with asthma who died between 2015 and 2021. A time-stratified case-crossover design was applied to assess the short-term effects of air pollution exposure on mortality. The daily average PM2.5 concentrations were calculated for case and referent dates. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for mortality across quartiles of PM2.5 exposure, adjusting for environmental variables and holidays. The highest quartile of PM2.5 exposure (lag 0) was associated with a higher odds ratio for mortality (aOR 1.048, 95% CI 1.021-1.077, p for trend = 0.022) compared to the lowest quartile. Similar trends were observed for lag 1 (aOR 1.032, 95% CI 1.005-1.060, p for trend = 0.015) and lag 0-1 (aOR 1.022, 95% CI 0.994-1.051, p for trend = 0.008). This study provides epidemiological evidence of an association between short-term exposure to PM2.5 and an increased mortality risk among older adults with asthma. These findings highlight the need for targeted preventive management strategies to mitigate health risks associated with short-term PM2.5 exposure, particularly for those vulnerable to air pollution."
Climate Change and Childhood Asthma: A Scoping Review.,"Warming temperatures are associated with increasing incidence and severity of wildfires, extreme rainfall, and large storms. To provide an updated review of research into the impacts of climate-driven environmental factors on childhood asthma, and to frame future research needs, we carried out a scoping review focused on studies reported over the past 5 years in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Global Health. Data appear to be especially strong for an association of exposure to wildfire smoke (WFS) with adverse asthma outcomes, including in children. Additional evidence links severe weather events, temperature extremes, and extended pollen seasons with worse asthma outcomes. Experimental studies have established several specific pathways that could link these environmental factors with disease and could suggest potential preventive or treatment strategies. Future research needs to include a better understanding of key triggers and mechanistic pathways, and on mitigation strategies that could be applied immediately. Given the complex and multifactorial nature of how environmental exposures contribute to asthma, computational approaches will probably be critical to define causality in complex exposure mixtures, improve environmental exposure forecasting, and inform personalized asthma management."
Immunomodulatory and anti-apoptotic effects of pediatric anti-cough and asthma sirup in mice with cigarette smoke extract-induced asthma.,"Asthma, a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by inflammation and immunological abnormalities, was the focus of this study, which explored the mechanisms and efficacy of a pediatric anti-cough and asthma sirup in a cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-induced rat asthma model. A CSE-induced asthma rat model was treated with a sirup containing roasted ephedra, bitter almond, gypsum, and licorice. Key markers in serum/BALF were measured by ELISA. Inflammatory cells were analyzed by Giemsa staining, pathology by hematoxylin-eosin, and macrophage infiltration by CD68+ immunohistochemistry. Lung tissue apoptosis (TUNEL), and apoptosis-related proteins (Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3) plus phosphorylated NF-κB (all by Western blot) were evaluated. The sirup treatment significantly attenuated CSE-induced airway inflammation in asthmatic rats, shown by decreased serum IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration in BALF. It also restored oxidative balance by reversing MDA elevation and SOD reduction. Histopathologically, it alleviated peribronchial inflammation, cell infiltration, hemolysis, and alveolar septum thickening. Furthermore, it suppressed CSE-induced lung apoptosis, evidenced by fewer TUNEL-positive cells, reduced pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax and cleaved caspase-3), and increased anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, likely  The pediatric sirup holds therapeutic potential against CSE-induced asthma by regulating cytokine levels and decreasing pulmonary inflammation/apoptosis."

"Factors associated with respiratory symptoms in communities living near to and away from the railway used for coal transportation in La Guajira, Colombia.","To determine the level of association between the reporting of respiratory symptoms by individuals living near and away from the railway used for coal transportation, and risk factors related to living conditions, health history, environmental characteristics, and air quality in the area. Prospective longitudinal study with 3 cross-sectional moments over a year and a half. A structured survey was conducted, through which individuals with respiratory symptoms and associated risk factors were identified. Particular matter 2.5 (PM Over 60% of households are located near unpaved roads with heavy traffic, and dwelling conditions are not suitable for human lodging with low or no exchange of air from the outside to the inside, and critical overcrowding. The results showed a higher risk of respiratory symptoms in children with a history of asthma or malnutrition living in homes with large windows that allow air to enter and exit, and in adults with a history of asthma, hypertension, or cigarette smoking. No significant association was found between the population's respiratory symptoms and the concentration of particulate matter (PM There are various factors associated with the respiratory symptoms of communities located around the road used for coal transportation by train, including the history of certain diseases in the population and characteristics of the indoor and outdoor environment of households.

"Impact of Dust Storms on Airborne Bacteria, Heavy Metals, and Inflammatory Markers in Asthmatic Patients.","Asthma, a chronic bronchial disorder prevalent in children/adolescents, is exacerbated under environmental conditions like dust storms. The current study investigated heavy metal levels, airborne bacteria, and serum IL-4/IL-8 in asthmatics during before/after dust storms in Iraq's Al-Anbar, Baghdad, and Kirkuk provinces. Airborne heavy metals were quantified by ICP-MS, serum cytokines by ELISA, and bacterial communities via metagenomics. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (p < 0.05 significant). ICP-MS revealed considerably elevated post-storm concentrations of As, Ag, B, Ba, Co, Hg, Mg, Mn, Ni, Sn, S, Ti, and V. Asthmatic subjects presented with considerably elevated IL-4 and IL-8 post-storm (p < 0.05) compared to controls (p > 0.05). Metagenomics revealed storm-induced bacterial alterations: Al-Anbar contained elevated Burkholderiaceae, Methylophilaceae, and Rhodobacteraceae; Kirkuk contained elevated Ilumatobacteraceae, Microbacteriaceae, Burkholderiaceae, and Rhodobacteraceae. Baghdad's most prevalent species included Rhodocyclaceae (50%), Burkholderiaceae (17%), and Arcobacteraceae (4.5%). Al-Anbar was significantly richer in microbes (Chao1) and more diverse (Shannon) than other regions following the dust storm (p < 0.0001). These findings indicate that dust storms raise heavy metals, alter airborne bacteria, and increase inflammatory cytokines in asthma sufferers, and these emphasize their role in exacerbating asthma in Iraq."
Risk based ranking of prioritized pesticides: where the exposome meets comparative toxicogenomics.,"Pesticides play an essential role in modern agricultural systems by enhancing crop yields and controlling pest-related losses and are applied extensively across the globe. However, their pervasive use has led to widespread environmental contamination, including accumulation in household and environmental dust, a significant yet understudied pathway of human exposure. Despite growing evidence that dust ingestion serves as a critical route for pesticide uptake, the associated health hazards remain poorly quantified and understood. We developed a Reverse Dosimetry Evaluation System (RDES) to estimate internal exposure levels from urine (EDI"
Development and pilot of the BC Wildfire Smoke and Extreme Heat Action Plan: empowering patients with climate health readiness.,"Globally, wildfire smoke and extreme heat events are increasing in frequency and intensity. Western Canada, including the Province of British Columbia (BC), is impacted annually by these events, resulting in the accelerated development of public health messaging and emergency preparedness. It is particularly important to reach, educate and empower individuals who are highly susceptible to climate events, such as those with respiratory diseases, through targeted communication strategies delivered by trusted sources. We aimed to develop an evidence-informed action plan (AP) tool and pilot integration into clinical encounters with patients living with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).The project team developed a draft tool-a BC Wildfire Smoke and Extreme Heat AP document inspired by the concept of an Asthma AP-along with a guide to support healthcare providers in addressing questions during patient counselling sessions. Iterative feedback from trained patient partners, clinicians and knowledge translation specialists was incorporated to refine messaging and delivery. Use of the tool was piloted in clinical encounters between certified respiratory educators (CREs) and patients living with asthma and COPD in two regional health authorities. Additional process and content feedback was gathered via questionnaires and focus groups.Patients (project participants) reported that AP tool use increased their understanding and preparedness for wildfire smoke and extreme heat events. While the plan was positively received by providers in a CRE role, time constraints and staffing capacity were highlighted as barriers to implementation. Suggested improvements included strengthened public awareness, preseason deployment and enhancement of content and delivery. Additional quality improvement cycles are needed to increase readability, accessibility and actionability."

Medical-Legal Liability and Indoor Air Pollution in Non-Industrial Environments and Perspectives for Maternal and Child Health.,"Indoor air pollution (IAP) has emerged as a critical yet underrecognized threat to public health, particularly in non-industrial environments such as homes, schools, and healthcare facilities. As individuals spend approximately 90% of their time indoors, exposure to indoor pollutants-such as particulate matter, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and microbial contaminants-can lead to significant health risks. These risks disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing conditions. The effects range from mild respiratory symptoms to severe outcomes like asthma, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. This review investigates the sources, typologies, and health effects of indoor air pollutants, with a focus on their implications for maternal and child health. In particular, children's developing systems and higher metabolic intake make them more susceptible to airborne toxins. The study also explores the legal and regulatory frameworks surrounding indoor air quality (IAQ), emphasizing how increased awareness and scientific evidence are expanding the scope of medical-legal responsibility. Legal liabilities may arise for property owners, designers, or manufacturers when poor IAQ leads to demonstrable health outcomes. Despite growing concern, there remains a significant research gap concerning the long-term health effects of chronic low-level exposure in residential settings and the efficacy of mitigation strategies. The evolution of smart building technologies and green construction practices offers promising avenues to improve IAQ while maintaining energy efficiency. However, standards and regulations often lag behind scientific findings, highlighting the need for updated, enforceable policies that prioritize human health. This work underscores the urgency of a multidisciplinary and preventive approach to IAQ, integrating public health, environmental engineering, and legal perspectives. Future research should focus on real-time IAQ monitoring, targeted interventions for high-risk populations, and the development of comprehensive legal frameworks to ensure accountability and promote healthier indoor environments."
Correlation Between Air Quality and the Exacerbation of Asthma Symptoms in the Population of the United Arab Emirates.,"Background Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease, characterised by shortness of breath (SOB), wheeze, cough and chest tightness, that has a significant impact on quality of life and global health.

Exploratory analysis of the impact of sex on sputum proteomic response to inhaled wood smoke in humans.,"Wildfires have surged in frequency and severity and in 2022 contributed to nearly 30% of the fine inhalable particulate matter (PM2.5) in the United States. Health effects from wildfire-induced wood smoke (WS) exposure include worsened pre-existing lung diseases and lung function, increased emergency room visits, and increased risk of premature death. Evidence suggests that males and females have unique responses to air pollutants, but sex-specific responses to WS remain understudied. To evaluate whether males and females differentially respond to WS, we analyzed induced sputum in humans following a controlled chamber exposure to WS. A total of 79 participants were exposed to 500 µg/m3 of WS for 2 hours with intermittent exercise, and a subset of participants' samples were analyzed for cellularity and cytokine concentrations and protein expression in the sputum supernatants. Cell differentials were compared between pre-, 6 hours, and 24 hours post-exposure, and proteomic and cytokine signatures were compared between pre- and 24 hours post-exposure. 368 proteins were significantly different in females and 27 were significantly different in males post exposure. Pathway analysis revealed inhibition of leukocyte extravasation signaling, phagosome formation, and macrophage nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species pathways in females versus males. Females had a lower percentage of iNOS+ and higher percentage of CD301+ sputum macrophages versus males. Overall, this exploratory analysis suggests that in response to acute WS exposure, different pathways are affected in females compared with males. Future studies are needed to determine whether this confers an immune advantage and to understand the mechanisms of sex-specific WS-induced respiratory effects."
The Causal Link Between Air Pollution and Respiratory Diseases: Evidence from Granger Causality Test.,"Air pollution can exacerbate respiratory illnesses, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, bronchitis, and upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). This study investigated the causal relationship between air pollution and emergency department visits for certain respiratory illnesses, such as pneumonia, acute bronchitis, URTIs, and exacerbations of asthma and COPD. This study was conducted between 1 April 1 2023 and 30 March 2024. The causal relationship between the number of asthma, COPD, pneumonia, bronchitis, and URTI patients visiting the emergency department and air pollution levels was determined by conducting a Granger causality analysis. It was determined that the highest number of visits to the emergency room was in January, and the highest concentrations of air pollutants were in December. According to the results of the Granger causality test, there was a one-way causal relationship between nitrogen (NO), nitrogen oxide (NO There is a causal relationship between levels of air pollutants including NO, NO"
Influence of Saharan Dust Intrusions on Respiratory Medication Dispensing.,"Saharan dust intrusions (SDIs) are associated with poor air quality and adverse respiratory outcomes. However, their impact on real-world inhaler utilization remains insufficiently characterized. We aimed to examine the association between SDI and the dispensing of short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) and inhaled corticosteroid-long-acting beta-agonist (ICS-LABA) combinations in the Canary Islands, Spain. Pharmaceutical sales data for SABA and ICS-LABA were collected from 60 pharmacies in Santa Cruz de Tenerife (TF) and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (GC) between June 2017 and May 2022. SDI days were identified based on daily PM Over 60 months, SABA sales were 14.8% lower in TF compared with GC, while ICS-LABA sales were 10.9% higher. SDI presence was associated with significantly higher ICS-LABA dispensations in both provinces (+5.7% in TF, +10.2% in GC), whereas no association was found for SABA. ICS-LABA sales correlated weakly but significantly with both SDI frequency and PM SDIs in the Canary Islands are independently associated with increased dispensing of ICS-LABA maintenance therapy, particularly during winter months. Dispensing data offer a valuable population-level indicator of respiratory impact from natural airborne pollution and support the integration of environmental alerts into preventive respiratory care strategies."

Respiratory incidents in response to air quality deterioration in the summer and early autumn season.,"The paper presents the results of an ecological study completed within the warm seasonal period of 01/07/2024-31/10/2024. The aim is to assess the relationship between ambient air quality deterioration and acute respiratory incidents occurring in the inhabitants of Gliwice (Poland; Upper Silesian agglomeration). The number of daily medical services (MS) due to respiratory diseases and illnesses was obtained from the register of the National Health Fund (Silesian Voivodeship Branch in Katowice). The daily mean values of aerosanitary factors in Gliwice came from the mobile air pollution laboratory of the Silesian University of Technology in Poland. The relative risk (RR) of MS was estimated using a Poisson log-linear model considering independent environmental factors (meteorological factors and air pollutant concentrations) or confounding factors (astronomical season and day of the week). The highest number of MS due to respiratory diseases refers to acute nasopharyngitis and asthma exacerbation, mostly in children aged 0-9 years. A significant impact was observed in the case of particulate matter concentration increase and number of MS due to acute nasopharyngitis, laryngitis and tracheitis, pneumonia, asthma exacerbation, in the case of nitrogen oxides appropriately acute nasopharyngitis, bronchitis and/or bronchiolitis, pneumonia, asthma exacerbation. Additionally, a longer time of exposure was associated with a higher risk of MS due to respiratory incidents. The increase in wind speed and relative humidity was significantly associated with a higher number of bronchitis and asthma exacerbation while a higher temperature and higher 8-hour ozone concentration remain protective of both MS. The results are essential for effectively communicating environmental health risks, educating the public about potential threats, and pressuring legislators responsible for legislation and risk management."
DNA methylation: a potential mediator between air pollution exposures and asthma control.,"Exposure to air pollution is known to contribute to the development and exacerbation of asthma symptoms, impacting respiratory health through complex, not yet fully understood biological mechanisms. It is hypothesized that DNA methylation (DNAm) changes triggered by air pollutants may mediate these effects on asthma symptom control. We aimed to investigate the effects of air pollution on DNAm in peripheral blood and asthma control. We also explored whether DNAm could potentially mediate the relationship between air pollution exposure and asthma control. This study included 651 participants with asthma exposed to ambient air pollutants, NO Exposure to short-term PM These findings suggest that air pollution-associated changes in DNA methylation may affect asthma control for some loci, thus help elucidate underlying mechanisms in asthmatic patients. These epigenetic alterations highlight potential targets for understanding the pathophysiology of asthma due to air pollution. While our findings suggest possible links between air pollution, DNA methylation, and asthma control, more evidence is needed to establish causal relationships and unravel the complexities of these connections."
High humidity exposures and mechanisms in respiratory disease.,"Over the past five decades, anthropogenic activities have precipitated a sustained rise in global temperatures. This warming trend enhances the atmosphere's water-holding capacity, thereby elevating atmospheric humidity levels. Prolonged exposure to high humidity (HH) adversely impacts nearly all organ systems are increasingly being recognized. As the respiratory system interfaces directly with atmospheric conditions, HH exposure exerts immediate pathological effects on pulmonary structures and functions. The past decades in environmental medicine research have been characterised by a greater understanding of HH to respiratory disease. This Seminar reviews the impact of HH on a spectrum of prevalent respiratory disorders, with an emphasis on respiratory infectious diseases, chronic ventilatory dysfunction, allergic airway diseases, and particulate matter-induced lung injury."
Socioeconomic Disparities of Asthma Incidence Attributable to PM,"This study investigated the socioeconomic disparities of asthma incidence attributable to ambient particulate matter in aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM Asthma in children is a significant public health issue that can affect their health throughout their lives. Understanding and measuring the risk factors for developing asthma are essential to create targeted policy interventions. This study investigated the number of new asthma cases that were linked to exposure to fine particles among schoolchildren in California, U.S. We found that, in 1 year, 34,537 new cases of asthma in schoolchildren could be traced back to fine particle exposure. This study also examined how asthma, caused by fine particle exposure, affected schoolchildren differently based on their community's level of social vulnerability. Particularly in terms of race and ethnicity, our findings showed that communities with higher social vulnerability observed more new asthma cases among schoolchildren (209 additional cases per 100,000 schoolchildren). Because the differences in fine particle levels between more and less vulnerable communities are mainly due to traffic emissions, stricter regulations on vehicle emissions could help lower the number of new asthma cases in schoolchildren and address the unequal health impacts across different communities."
Biodiversity and childhood asthma: A nationwide retrospective birth cohort study in Japan.,"Empirical evidence to support an association between biodiversity and childhood asthma remains limited, and the contributions of specific taxonomic groups have been poorly understood. This nationwide, retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the associations between a wide range of biodiversity indices during pre-, peri-, and post-natal periods and childhood persistent asthma. We included child-mother dyads between January 2005 and January 2017 from the Japan Medical Data Center database. Species richness, net relatedness index (genetic diversity), and land-use types were defined based on the municipalities in which the children resided during each exposure period. The primary outcome was persistent asthma in children aged 4-5 years. Modified Poisson regression models were used to evaluate the association between the biodiversity indices and childhood persistent asthma. Results were adjusted for confounders and predictors of asthma, including infant sex, cesarean section delivery, parental history of asthma, particulate matter ≤2.5 µm in aerodynamic diameter, nitrogen dioxide, population density, metropolitan area status, municipality-level area deprivation index, and prefectural-level smoking prevalence. A total of 109,233 child-mother dyads were included; 34.7% of the children had persistent asthma at 4-5 years of age. Greater species and genetic diversity of freshwater fish, along with stagnant water areas, were consistently associated with a 2-5% lower risk of childhood asthma. Biodiversity during early life was heterogeneously associated with childhood asthma. These findings suggest that conserving freshwater fish species and their habitats may contribute to asthma prevention in children."
Occupational asthma: dust exposure as a contributory factor and implications for classification of respiratory sensitisers.,"Occupational asthma (AO) is an important chronic respiratory disease associated with airway narrowing. Chemicals that cause OA are regulated under the UN GHS endpoint of respiratory sensitisation. Such chemicals are typically identified using evidence suggesting work-related exposure resulting in the ab initio development of asthma, rather than simply aggravating pre-existing asthma (work exacerbated asthma; WEA). There exist predisposing and aggravating factors within and outside the workplace that influence the development and severity of the disease. Inhalation exposure to dusts is one factor and is recognised as directly causing respiratory disease, and also aggravating pre-existing disease, including asthma. Here the contribution of dusts to the development of work-related asthma has been re-examined with reference to published clinical case studies. The data reveal a link between exposure to dusts and OA, suggesting an additional role of dust in this respect may be the presentation of irritant or sensitising agents in a way that promotes the development of OA, even under conditions where exposure to those agents alone does not. We propose that the significance of co-exposure to dusts may be currently under-estimated in health management of OA, clinical identification of chemicals suspected of causing OA, and classification of true respiratory sensitisers."
Association between prenatal ambient particulate matter and childhood asthma is modified by community safety and child sex.,"Studies document independent effects of prenatal air pollution exposure and social environmental factors, including neighborhood safety, on childhood asthma development with documented sex-specific effects.

"Invisible hazards of ultrafine particles (UFPs) from Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) fire smoke as emerging public health risks: A critical review of transformation dynamics from emission sources, exposure pathways, and vulnerable population to WUI fire toxicants.","This review synthesizes atmospheric chemistry, toxicology, and environmental justice to assess public health risks from ultrafine particles (UFPs, <100 nm) in Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) fire smoke. It explores UFP emission sources, transformation dynamics, exposure pathways, and disproportionate impacts on vulnerable populations, while evaluating advanced characterization methods and identifying knowledge gaps and formulating systematic future research directions. WUI fires, driven by climate change and urban expansion, produce UFPs accounting for 77-90 % of particle number concentrations (up to 1.25 × 10 Critical gaps include standardized real-time UFP monitoring, poor understanding of aging dynamics, incomplete emission profiles from mixed fuels, and insufficient data on UFP-PAH toxicity and heavy metal emissions from electric vehicles (EVs) involved in WUI fires. This review advocates enhanced real-time monitoring and systematic future research directions to unveil the risks of UFPs from WUI Fires and mitigate WUI fire smoke impacts."
Air Purifier Intervention for Respiratory Viral Exposure in Elementary Schools: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.,"The magnitude of school respiratory virus exposure and the effectiveness of environmental mitigation measures remain unclear. To evaluate whether portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) purifiers are associated with reduced respiratory virus exposure in elementary school classrooms. This ad hoc secondary analysis was performed between July 2023 and September 2024 and used data from a cluster-randomized, placebo-controlled trial (School Inner-City Asthma Intervention Study) of HEPA purifiers conducted from September 2015 to June 2020. A total of 200 classrooms from 39 public schools in Northeastern US were enrolled and randomized. Classrooms were randomized 1:1 to receive either active HEPA purifiers or visually identical sham HEPA units (4 per classroom). School staff and investigators were blinded to intervention assignments. The primary outcome was high viral exposure, identified by K-means clustering of individual viral concentrations. Secondary outcomes included viral diversity (defined as number of detected virus types) and individual viral concentrations. Week-long bioaerosol samples were collected 3 times during 1 school year, and concentrations of 19 respiratory viruses were quantified by digital droplet polymerase chain reaction. Of the 200 enrolled classrooms (91 in the sham purifier group and 109 in the HEPA purifier group) analyzed, the median (IQR) class size was 19 (18-20) and the median (IQR) grade was 3 (2-5). A total of 532 bioaerosol samples were collected; viruses were detected in 524 samples (98.5%), with a median (IQR) of 3 (2-5) viruses per classroom. Rhinovirus was most prevalent (476 [89.5%]), while respiratory syncytial virus A and B (66 [12.4%] and 127 [23.9%]) as well as influenza A and B (94 [17.7%] and 76 [14.3%]) were also detected. High viral exposure was present in 118 samples (22.2%). The HEPA purifier intervention was not associated with lower odds of high viral exposure (odds ratio [OR], 0.50; 95% CI, 0.08-3.25; P = .46) but did correspond to a modest reduction in viral diversity (β = -1.02; 95% CI, -1.68 to -0.35; P = .003). Elastic net regression identified relative humidity, grade, winter season, and coarse particulate matter as the environmental risk factors for viral exposure. In this secondary analysis, HEPA purifiers were not associated with a reduction in high viral exposure but were associated with a modest decrease in viral diversity. Multicomponent interventions may be needed to mitigate respiratory viral exposures in schools."
Comprehensive indoor phthalate risk assessment: A multimedia exposure framework for quantifying population health risk and disease burden.,"Phthalates (PAEs) represent ubiquitous indoor contaminants with widespread occurrence in residential environments, posing significant health risks through multiple simultaneous exposure pathways. This study developed a novel multimedia exposure assessment framework integrating settled dust, air, drinking water, and food matrices to quantify PAE exposure doses, health risks, and disease burden. Among the six target PAEs, DEHP dominated in settled dust (median: 183 μg/g), while lower molecular weight PAEs prevailed in indoor air, with DBP showing the highest concentration (1319 ng/m"

Particulate matter 2.5 promotes pulmonary fibrosis in allergic asthma through macrophage reprogramming toward the M2 phenotype.,"Inhaled particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5, ≤ 2.5 μm) exacerbates airway inflammation and promotes fibrosis in allergic asthma. However, most studies have focused on airway inflammation, and direct evidence linking PM2.5 to fibrosis in allergic asthma remains limited. Here, we investigated how PM2.5 promotes fibrotic progress in allergic asthma, focusing on macrophage plasticity. PM2.5 induced neutrophil-dominant acute inflammation, whereas house dust mite (HDM) induced T helper 2- and immunoglobulin (Ig) E-dependent allergic responses accompanied by airway hyperresponsiveness. Strikingly, combined exposure to HDM and PM2.5 progressed beyond airway inflammation to pulmonary fibrosis, with upregulated tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-5, IL-13, IgE, collagen I, and transforming growth factor-β"
Long-term exposure to air pollution and metabolites in children and young adults in a Swedish birth cohort.,"The biochemical dysregulation underlying the adverse health effects of exposure to air pollution (AP) remains unclear. The objective of this study was to explore associations between long-term exposure to AP and the urinary metabolome. In the Swedish birth cohort BAMSE (n = 4089), urine samples were collected from a subset of participants attending clinical examination at the 4-year follow-up and from all participants attending clinical examination at the 24-year follow-up. Among paired samples and children with diagnosis of asthma and/or low lung function, non-targeted screening using liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry was applied to 4-year samples (n = 612) and 24-year samples (n = 846) and metabolites were annotated based on standard matching to in-house compound libraries (n = 260 metabolites). Time-weighted average exposure to air pollutants (i.e., particulate matter with diameter ≤10μm (PM AP exposure was overall positively associated with metabolite abundance (p < 0.002). However, metabolite-specific associations exhibited variability. At the 4-year follow-up, the first-year-of-life and prior-year AP exposures were positively associated with 8 purine/pyrimidine derivative metabolites (e.g., an increase of 2.8 μg/m Long-term exposure to air pollution alters urinary metabolites in children and young adults, revealing environmental impacts on systemic metabolism even at low levels of air pollution."

Epidemiological and Clinical Evidence on the Association Between Wildfire PM2.5 and Pulmonary Health Outcomes.,"As climate change accelerates the frequency and severity of wildfires worldwide, the pulmonary consequences of wildfire smoke exposure have emerged as an important yet under-recognized public health concern. Wildfire-related fine particulate matter (PM2.5) possesses distinct toxicologic properties compared to urban PM2.5 and disproportionately affects vulnerable populations, including children, older adults, and individuals with chronic respiratory diseases. This narrative review synthesizes current epidemiological, mechanistic, and clinical evidence on the impact of wildfire PM2.5 on exacerbations and progression of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and interstitial lung disease (ILD), drawing from recent large-scale meta-analyses and international cohort studies. We reviewed data from over 30 peer-reviewed sources, including longitudinal cohorts, systematic reviews, environmental modeling studies, and public health guidelines. Special attention was given to pediatric populations, the elderly, and patients with pre-existing pulmonary conditions. Wildfire PM2.5 is consistently associated with significant increases in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for asthma and COPD, with relative risks often exceeding those of urban PM2.5. Pediatric asthma-related visits may increase by over 30% during wildfire events, while elderly COPD patients face heightened hospitalization and mortality risks. ILD patients, especially those with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), exhibit higher rates of acute exacerbations and accelerated disease progression with PM2.5 levels as low as 8-10 μg/m³. Mechanistically, wildfire PM2.5 promotes oxidative stress, epithelial injury, and immune dysregulation, contributing to disease exacerbation and chronic progression. Preventive interventions such as high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration, indoor sheltering, and respiratory protection significantly reduce PM2.5 exposure and related morbidity. Wildfire PM2.5 is a potent and growing contributor to pulmonary morbidity, with a higher toxicity profile than other ambient air pollutants. While acute impacts are well-documented, long-term consequences remain understudied. Urgent research is needed to define chronic health outcomes, develop interventions, and inform public health policy. As wildfires become more frequent and intense globally, clinicians must be prepared to recognize and manage the growing burden of wildfire-related pulmonary disease."
Indoor and ambient air pollution dataset using a multi-instrument approach and total event monitoring.,"Indoor air quality (IAQ) significantly influences human health, as individuals spend up to 90% of their time indoors, where air pollutants can accumulate and interact dynamically. Despite advancements in monitoring technology, challenges remain in capturing the temporal and spatial variability of pollutants and understanding the interaction between indoor and outdoor environments. This study addresses these gaps by introducing a comprehensive dataset from a controlled experimental room in Croatia, leveraging a multi-instrumental approach to monitor IAQ across various real-life scenarios. The dataset integrates measurements from low-cost sensors, reference-grade devices, and auxiliary systems to track pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), black carbon (BC), volatile organic compounds (VOC), and indoor events deemed relevant for the assessment of pollutant levels. Key experiments simulated household activities, including cooking, cleaning, human presence, and ventilation, capturing their impacts on IAQ with high temporal resolution. The resulting dataset comprises over 19 subsets. This work contributes to the Horizon EDIAQI project, supporting the development of evidence-driven strategies to improve IAQ."
Functional Variant Discovery Identifies a Novel Genetic Link Between ,"As a consequence of climate change and land use policies, there has been a historic rise in wildfire smoke across the United States and the world. While the deleterious effects of wildfire smoke and associated air pollution on asthma outcomes are established epidemiologically, genetic risks and molecular mechanisms of how wildfire smoke affects asthma are unknown. This knowledge gap hinders the identification of high-risk individuals and the creation of targeted therapies or recommendations to protect these individuals. We identified 52 genetic risk variants that colocalized with genomic responses to wood smoke particles (WSP), a model of wildfire particulate matter, and associated with asthma in the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging (GERA) cohort. We used additional filters to prioritize variants for direct testing of allele-dependent transcriptional regulatory function in plasmid reporters. We found that the rs3861144 variant (Odds Ratio"

This review explores the environmental contexts and lifestyle determinants of pediatric asthma, with a focus on the Inland Empire (IE) region of Southern California. The IE's unique geographic landscape and importance as a major transportation hub highlights its critical role for understanding how both environmental and structural factors exacerbate asthma burden within the pediatric population. Variables such as household income, parental education levels, and lack of community-based asthma programs were explored. Despite significant burdens, the IE remains under-represented in asthma research, contributing to persistent disparity. A narrative literature review and regional data analysis were conducted via PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar (2000-2025), alongside data from the CDC, CDPH, and American Lung Association. Key words used included ""pediatric asthma, Inland Empire, air pollution, asthma disparity, emergency department utilization, socioeconomic status."" Inclusion criteria were: (1) studies or reports focusing on pediatric asthma (ages 0-17), (2) articles addressing environmental, socioeconomic, or health care-related risk factors, and (3) research with either national, state-level, or IE-specific data. Exclusion criteria were: (1) articles not in English, adult-only asthma studies, and (3) publications without original data or reference to pediatric asthma burden, management, or outcomes. Titles and abstracts were screened for relevance, and full texts were reviewed when abstracts met inclusion criteria. A total of 61 studies, reports, and data sources met this criterion and were included into this review. The IE-comprised of San Bernardino (SB) and Riverside Counties- is home to four of the top five most polluted cities in North America. Vehicle emissions and industrial waste are concentrated in the region due to limited air circulation from surrounding mountains that entrap pollutants. Pediatric asthma ED visit rates in SB and Riverside were 60.5% and 59.3%, compared to California's average of 56.7%. Hospitalization rates for children aged 0-4 were also higher in SB (24.4%) compared to the state average (17.3%). The elevated rates among school-aged children underscore the crucial need for interventions aimed at improving air quality, enhancing asthma management, and increasing access to preventive health care. Pediatric asthma in the IE reflects heightened environmental risks, socioeconomic barriers, and gaps in health care access. Addressing these disparities requires targeted interventions, policies, and region-specific research to enhance long-term management strategies and outcomes for vulnerable pediatric populations."
The Role of Oxidative Stress in the Pathogenesis of Childhood Asthma: A Comprehensive Review.,"This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of how oxidative stress drives inflammation, structural remodeling, and clinical expression of childhood asthma, while critically appraising emerging redox-sensitive biomarkers and antioxidant-focused preventive and therapeutic strategies. Oxidative stress arises when reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) outpace airway defenses. This surplus provokes airway inflammation: ROS/RNS activate nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1), recruit eosinophils and neutrophils, and amplify type-2 cytokines. Normally, an antioxidant network-glutathione (GSH), enzymes such as catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-maintains redox balance. Prenatal and early exposure to fine particulate matter <2.5 micrometers (µm) (PM"
"Immune development in urban children and its relationship to environmental exposures, allergic sensitization, and asthma.","Early-life environmental exposures influence the incidence of allergic diseases and asthma, possibly by modifying immune development. Exposure to selected indoor aeroallergens has been associated with reduced wheezing and childhood asthma. We sought to determine whether allergen exposure in early life promotes immune development and reduces asthma risk. From birth through age 7, we measured cytokine responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 442 children in the Urban Environment and Childhood Asthma study. We then compared allergen and endotoxin levels in house dust collected in the first 3 years to cytokine responses, atopy and longitudinal allergic sensitization trajectories, and asthma (age 7). Cord blood cytokine responses had unique features but were poorly predictive of subsequent responses. Early cockroach, mouse, and cat allergen exposures were significantly associated with selected IFN-α, IL-12p40, and TNF responses to innate stimuli, mitogen-induced IFN-γ (cockroach and mouse), and dust mite-induced IFN-γ (mouse) at age 7. Early onset of aeroallergic sensitization was positively associated with allergen-induced type 2 responses that started at ages 1-3 years and intensified at ages 5-7. In logistic regression models, cytokine responses modestly predicted atopy but not asthma (AUROC 0.69 ± 0.14 and 0.57 ± 0.08, respectively). Associations between preschool aeroallergen exposures and cytokine responses through age 7 years suggest a possible role in modifying systemic immune development. Progressively increasing aeroallergen-induced type 2 responses were associated with early-onset allergic sensitization. In contrast, asthma at age 7 was not associated with distinct cytokine responses, perhaps reflecting the multiple inflammatory mechanisms related to early-onset childhood asthma."
Pro-inflammatory and oxidative responses to burn pit relevant desert particulate matter in macrophages: A role for TLR2 signaling.,"Particulate matter (PM) exposure is linked to many respiratory diseases such as asthma, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. A large number of warfighters deployed to Afghanistan and Iraqi have developed deployment related respiratory disease. This study investigates the effects of burn pit-relevant desert PM from Afghanistan (APM) and comparative desert PM from China Lake, California (CPM) on oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory responses in macrophages. Using mouse monocyte cell line and primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with or without Toll-like Receptor 2 (TLR2) deficiency, we assessed nitric oxide (NO"
Work-related airways disease and risk factors in Mozambiquan wood processing workers.,"Inhalation of wood dust particulates, bioaerosols and chemical components cause airway disease of a sensitising or irritative nature. This study investigated the disease burden and factors associated with work-related airways disease among wood processors. A cross-sectional study enrolled 450 workers from 21 Mozambican wood mill and furniture industries. Work-related asthma (WAS) and work-related ocular-nasal (WONS) symptoms were evaluated, using European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) questionnaire. Objective assessments included spirometry, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and Phadiatop tests. The average age was 38 years, three-quarters did not smoke and almost half were atopic. The proportion of workers with WAS was 14% and WONS was 40%. There were 3% that demonstrated bronchial reversibility, 16% fixed airway obstruction and 5% with FeNO > 50 ppb. WONS was positively correlated with female sex [odds ratio (OR) = 2.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15-5.90] and atopy (OR = 2.04, 95% CI 1.20-3.47). Bronchial reversibility was associated with increasing age (OR = 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.10), atopy correlated with high FeNO (OR = 2.85, 95% CI 1.09-7.44). Processing Mutondo wood was positively correlated with WAS (ORadj = 3.68, 95% CI 1.58-8.58), and WONS (ORadj = 9.34, 95% CI 4.54-19.20). Certain wood types, Missanda (ORadj = 6.84, 95% CI 4.17-11.20), Panga-panga (ORadj = 2.31 95% CI 1.49-3.60) and Mahogany bean (ORadj = 2.52, 95% CI 1.41-4.51) were primarily correlated with WONS. Mozambiquan wood processors experience significant work-related airway disease attributable to dust particulate. Mutondo wood type, was positively correlated with both lower and upper airway symptoms, whereas other species were linked only to upper airway symptoms."
Wildfire and asthma - The prospective interventions.,"The increasing global warming trend has led to a drier landscape, which has in turn resulted in an increased incidence of wildfires. The smoke emanating from these fires has consequences that extend beyond the loss of property. This comes with the wildfire season whose smoke emanations have implications beyond loss of property. Among the health concerns regarding wildfires and smoke are respiratory diseases, such as asthma. Asthma, as a heterogeneous disease, is directly linked to other types of smoke rather than cigarettes, traffic exhaust, and industrial chemicals. Wildfires have been shown to be associated with particulate matter that act as pollutants to human life. The unprecedented increase in emergency visits during wildfire seasons is of clinical significance for its association with asthma and other pulmonary disorders. Despite the efforts of wealthy communities or nations, which have faced episodes of wildfires in recent years, the most effective protocol is yet to be developed. Given the vulnerability of individuals, including asthmatics, to the smoke from wildfires, interventions should extend beyond emergency measures. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the relationship between wildfires and asthma symptoms, exploring the underlying mechanisms both "
Association between daily variations in the levels of atmospheric O,"Environmental pollution is a significant public health issue in Mexico City. Patients with respiratory or cardiovascular diseases such as asthma or hypertension often experience exacerbations triggered by environmental factors. This retrospective time series epidemiological study analyzed the association between daily air pollution levels and the numbers of medical visits for exacerbations of cardiorespiratory diseases. Records from primary, secondary, and tertiary hospitals of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) were reviewed between 2017 and 2019. Air quality data, including PM PM This study provides strong evidence that short term exposure to elevated concentrations of atmospheric pollutants, specifically PM"
Differences in the morbidity of asthma in multi temperature zones under short-term exposure to air pollution: a systematic review.,"Different geographical locations and climatic environments lead to different impacts of specific air pollutants on the relative risk (RR) of asthma morbidity (i.e., new-onset asthma, outpatient visits, emergency department visits, and hospital admissions) in the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate existing data to assess the impact of short-term exposure to pollutants on the RR of asthma morbidity in the Northern Hemisphere. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of short-term exposure to particulate matter (PM"

"Clean Air for Asthma and Allergy Programme (CAAP), a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of multicomponent interventions to reduce indoor triggers in childhood asthma.","Multicomponent interventions have been reported as effective strategies for improving allergen reduction and asthma control. However, few studies have evaluated the integration of an indoor air quality (IAQ) system and e-health as part of multicomponent interventions. To evaluate the effects of multicomponent interventions on house dust mite allergens, indoor particulate matter, and knowledge and trigger reduction behaviors (TRBs) of caregivers. Twelve pediatric asthmatic patients with dust mite sensitization were randomly assigned to either a multicomponent intervention group or a control group. In the multicomponent intervention group, IAQ systems were installed in participants' bedrooms, bedding covers were provided, and asthma education was delivered through the LINE application, while the control group received conventional treatment. House dust mite allergen levels were analyzed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, and particulate matter <2.5 micrometer diameter (PM2.5) concentrations were measured at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks postenrollment. Questionnaires were used to evaluate TRBs and asthma knowledge among caregivers before and after the intervention. There were decreased Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus allergen group 1 and Dermatophagoides farinae allergen group 1 levels in the multicomponent intervention group compared to the control group; however, the reduction was not statistically significant. Indoor PM2.5 concentrations were significantly lower in the multicomponent intervention group compared to the control group after 4 and 8 weeks ( Implementation of an IAQ system and asthma education through the LINE application, as part of multicomponent interventions, resulted in a significant reduction in indoor PM2.5 concentrations and improved TRBs among caregivers."

Characteristics and Risk Factors of Pollen-Food Allergy Syndrome in Patients With Hay Fever: A Digital Cross-Sectional Cohort Study Using AllerSearch.,"Pollen-food allergy syndrome (PFAS) is a frequent comorbidity in individuals with hay fever. Identifying risk factors and allergen clusters can aid targeted interventions and management strategies. Objective: This study characterizes PFAS in patients with hay fever and identifies associated risk factors using the mobile health platform, AllerSearch. A digital cross-sectional cohort study was conducted in Japan from August 2020 to September 2024. Participants provided demographic, medical, lifestyle, and environmental data via AllerSearch. PFAS was identified based on self-reported allergic reactions to specific fruits and vegetables. Allergen patterns were analyzed using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection clustering, and risk factors were assessed via multivariable logistic regression. Among 2874 participants, 2352 had hay fever, and 1788 (23.9%) reported PFAS. The most common triggers were melon (22.9%), kiwi (18.3%), and tomato (11.7%). Significant risk factors included a history of allergic disease (OR, 1.58), asthma (1.44), atopic dermatitis (1.90), urticaria (2.73), contact lens discontinuation during hay fever season (1.50), sensitivity to yellow sand or particulate matter 2.5 (3.42), and drug allergy (3.04). Seven allergen clusters were identified, with Cluster 6 exhibiting broad allergen sensitivity and the remaining clusters each associated with a single food. Onset of hay fever was earlier in Clusters 1, 4, and 6 than in non-PFAS individuals (P=.002, P=.002, and P=.002, respectively). This study highlights key factors and allergen clusters associated with PFAS using a mobile health approach. Our findings may facilitate tailored interventions and improve quality of life for affected individuals."
"Air pollution and diseases: signaling, G protein-coupled and Toll like receptors.","Air pollution is a significant public health issue that impacts lung health, particularly in vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing respiratory conditions. Both natural and anthropogenic sources of air pollution give rise to a variety of toxic compounds, including particulate matter (PM), ozone (O₃), sulfur dioxide (SO₂), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), carbon monoxide (CO), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Exposure to these pollutants is strongly associated with the development and exacerbation of respiratory diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Notably, early life exposure to pollutants such as PM, NO₂, and O₃ is linked to an increased risk of childhood asthma. Air pollution can mediate adverse effects through effects on receptor signaling pathways, particularly those involving G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Both of these receptor families play key roles in regulating pulmonary function and immune responses. GPCRs are involved in mediating cellular responses via cyclic AMP (cAMP), calcium and other second messengers, while TLRs initiate immune responses. Understanding how air pollutants and cigarette smoke alter GPCR and TLR function to contribute to lung disease is a critical area of study, as these receptors play central roles in regulating inflammation, immune responses, oxidative stress, airway remodeling and airway tone. Disruption of their signaling by pollutants can exacerbate respiratory conditions such as asthma and COPD. This review explores what is known about how air pollution impacts GPCR and TLR signaling, offers insights into the mechanisms underlying respiratory disease development and highlights potential therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the impact of air pollution on lung health."

"Gathering baseline data to assess household energy interventions' impact on indoor air quality, occupant health, and wellbeing: In2Air a non-randomized experiment.","Tackling climate change, together with improving indoor air quality, offers a significant opportunity to improve residents' health and well-being. This requires the evidence base to inform an energy-efficient retrofit design. (i) To develop a protocol that could be implemented by local authorities across a range of housing typologies and (ii) to deploy this protocol to establish baseline conditions in  Working with the local council and the community, this baseline study (In2Air) developed and deployed a protocol across 30 single-storey one- and two-bedroom properties owned by Newcastle City Council, United Kingdom, and occupied by tenants (> 55 years). The following data were collected before homes underwent a fabric-first intervention: indoor and outdoor air quality (for ~3 weeks); energy consumption (for ~12 months); occupant behaviour and home-specific details; self-reported general health and well-being. The collected baseline data indicated that the mean PM Our study focused on changes to the building envelope across a limited number of building types and parameters and utilised fixed, low-cost sensors at indoor and outdoor monitoring locations rather than personal air quality monitors. The baseline conditions reported in this article provide the basis on which to inform and evaluate the effects of energy-efficient refurbishment across this social housing stock as part of future research. The developed protocol and the study findings offer the potential to support and inform decision-making of council retrofit teams across the United Kingdom with their ongoing decarbonisation plans. This article presents independent research funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Public Health Research programme as award number NIHR153617. Everyday activities can release harmful substances into the indoor air we breathe. Breathing polluted air can cause or worsen respiratory problems like asthma and lung diseases. It can also lead to heart problems and even cancer. Homes need good ventilation to be healthy. Making homes more energy efficient is important for combating climate change. Energy efficiency of homes can be improved by insulation and better sealing of windows and doors; however, these measures also reduce natural ventilation, so additional ventilation (extractor fans and window air vents) may be necessary. To understand how making homes more energy efficient (so-called ‘retrofitting’) affects the indoor air quality, health and well-being of occupants, we began by measuring conditions before home modifications started (the baseline). We designed a study to measure the baseline data on 30 single story, one- and two- bedroomed homes and their occupants. We measured the indoor and outdoor air qualities, energy use and asked participants to complete a questionnaire about their home and their general health. Other than three homes where smoking occurred indoors, no homes were above the current (2019) United Kingdom limits for the amount of fine particles in the air, but if we use the stricter World Health Organization (2021) limit, then 21 homes had poor indoor air quality. Typically, the highest concentration of particles was recorded during the daytime and usually around mealtimes such as breakfast, lunch and dinner. Our monitoring provided the necessary information on 30 homes and their occupants before the retrofit works began. We now need to monitor these same homes again once the retrofitting has been completed so that we can look at any changes. This future work will make recommendations to ensure that improving the energy efficiency of homes does not accidentally cause health problems for the people living in these homes."
Air pollution and alveolar health.,"Exposure to air pollution has been associated with up to 9 million premature deaths per year worldwide, with the respiratory system a key site for its effects. Air pollution exposure is a well-established risk factor for the development and exacerbation of airways diseases and lung cancer, however relatively little is known regarding the risks associated with air pollution interacting with areas of gas exchange - the alveoli and pulmonary interstitium. In recent years, evidence has emerged identifying a role in the development and progression of sub-clinical interstitial lung abnormalities as well as progression and risk of exacerbation of fibrotic interstitial lung diseases. This review outlines the epidemiologic evidence that air pollution perturbs alveolar health. It considers the different components of ambient air pollution, how penetration to the alveoli is determined by particle size and whether the response to alveolar exposure may be modulated by personal susceptibility factors. We discuss potential acute and chronic pathogenic mechanisms of injury upon the pulmonary interstitium and how these may contribute to the development and/or progression of interstitial processes. Finally, we explore current knowledge gaps and the potential for air pollution interventions in vulnerable individuals to support alveolar homeostasis and so prevent disease development and/or progression."
Cancer incidence and proximity to coal ash impoundments in the United States.,"Across the United States (U.S.), many communities experience disproportionate exposure to environmental health hazards due to their proximity to coal-fired power plants and associated coal ash disposal sites. These facilities release toxic heavy metals such as arsenic, mercury, and lead into the surrounding environment, posing serious public health risks. Although prior research has documented adverse health effects of coal-fired power plants, few studies have specifically examined the relationship between cancer incidence and proximity to coal ash impoundments, as well as exposure to elevated concentrations of toxic constituents in coal ash. Using complementary contingency table analyses, bivariate spatial association techniques, and spatial regression methods, this study finds consistent evidence that counties containing or adjacent to coal ash impoundments exhibit significantly higher cancer incidence rates compared to more distant counties, even after adjusting for potential confounders. Incidence rates for both total cancer and lung cancer were significantly associated with smoking, drinking, and physical inactivity, corroborating prior research on these behavioral risk factors. The lung cancer model further revealed significant positive associations between cancer incidence and PM₂.₅, arsenic concentrations, and airborne cancer risk scores, highlighting specific environmental risk factors for the disease. These findings strengthen the evidence linking coal ash exposure to adverse health outcomes and underscore the urgent need for robust enforcement and compliance measures to protect communities from coal ash contamination."
Quantifying the effect of air pollution and temperature on hospitalization costs for chronic lower respiratory diseases.,"Environmental exposure is a crucial factor contributing to the increasing health and economic burden of chronic lower respiratory diseases (CLRDs). This study aims to quantify the effects of environmental exposure on hospitalization costs associated with CLRDs and their population heterogeneity, thus providing a scientific basis for formulating more precise and effective cost-control policies. Hospital admission records from seven major tertiary hospitals in Changchun from 2017 to 2020 were collected, as were environmental monitoring and meteorological data. A generalized additive model and distributed lag nonlinear model were employed to identify the exposure-response relationships and lag effects of pollutants and temperature. A total of 23,569 patients with CLRDs were included. Most of the participants were male (50.83%) and aged 60 years and older (63.42%), with hospitalization costs accounting for 54.22 and 67.96% of total costs, respectively. When the concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO A significant association was observed between increased air pollutant concentrations and the hospitalization costs of patients with CLRDs, with heterogeneity among different populations. Specifically, the effects of SO"
Caspase-1 Dependent Neutrophil Pyroptosis Contributes to Fine Particulate Matter-Induced Lung Inflammation.,"As a pollutant, Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) directly deposits in alveoli to induce lung inflammation, yet its pathogenic mechanism remains unclear. PM2.5-induced pulmonary inflammation will trigger the activation of Caspase-1 (Casp1). We seek to elucidate the role of pyroptosis in PM2.5-induced lung inflammation by employing Casp1 knock-out (KO) mice and a specific pyroptosis inhibitor (Disulfiram, DSF). We found the typical pathological changes were comparatively alleviated in the Casp1 KO mice. Notably, in Casp1 KO mice, there was a significant downregulation of gasdermin D (GSDMD) and GSDMD-N at the protein levels. The Casp1 KO mice exhibited a decrease in the numbers of pyroptotic neutrophils. After administrating with DSF, we observed the downregulation of GSDMD and GSDMD-N, along with a decreased number of pyroptotic neutrophils. These findings suggest that neutrophils contribute to PM2.5-induced lung inflammation depending on Caspase-1/pyroptosis signaling pathway. These results demonstrate that PM2.5 triggers lung inflammation via the neutrophil Caspase-1/pyroptosis pathway, revealing a novel mechanism of PM2.5-mediated inflammation and suggesting DSF as a potential therapeutic agent for PM2.5-induced pneumonia."
Wildfire-related PM2.5 and respiratory transmitted disease among Chinese children and adolescents from 2008 to 2019: A retrospective study.,"Exposure to fine particles (PM2.5) from wildfires is known to cause deaths and chronic diseases, but its effect on respiratory infections, especially in children and adolescents, is not well characterized. We aimed to comprehensively assess the association between short-term exposure to wildfire-related PM2.5 and the incidence and mortality of respiratory transmitted diseases in children and adolescents. Data on daily counts of incident and mortality cases of respiratory transmitted diseases in persons aged 4-24 years old were collected from China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention, covering 501 cities from 2008 to 2019. Daily concentrations of wildfire-related PM2.5 were estimated using machine learning and chemical transport models at a 0.25°×0.25° spatial resolution. We used time-stratified case-crossover design with conditional logistic regression to estimate the association between short-term exposures to wildfire-related PM2.5 and incidence and mortality of respiratory transmitted diseases, adjusting for temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, and total PM2.5. There were 6,089,271 incident cases and 1,034 mortality cases of 10 respiratory transmitted diseases included in our analyses. Each 5 μg/m3 increase in the lag 0-28-day (average of current day and previous 28 days) for wildfire-related PM2.5 was associated with a 6.8% (95%CI: 5.0%, 8.7%) increase in the daily incidence rate of respiratory transmitted diseases, which is greater than that of a 1.2% (1.0%, 1.4%) increase associated with the same increase of non-wildfire-related PM2.5. A 5 μg/m3 increase in wildfire-related PM2.5 was associated with a 28.6% (21.0%, 36.8%), 5.2% (2.3%, 8.3%), 12.6% (9.5%, 15.8%), and 13.6% (5.6%, 22.2%) increase in the incidence of seasonal influenza, scarlet fever, rubella, and measles, respectively. Although wildfire-related PM2.5 constitutes only 2.7% of the total PM2.5, it contributes significantly to respiratory transmitted diseases, accounting for 10.8% of all PM2.5-associated cases. In areas where the annual concentration of wildfire-related PM2.5 is lower than 1.5 μg/m3, the proportion of cases associated with wildfire-related PM2.5 reached 29.7%. Study limitations include potential exposure misclassification from using city-average wildfire PM2.5 as a proxy for individual exposure and an inability to adjust for some potential confounders. Short-term exposure to wildfire-related PM2.5 was associated with increased incidence of respiratory transmitted diseases, surpassing the impact observed with non-wildfire-related PM2.5. This phenomenon is not restricted to regions with high pollutant concentrations; even populations residing in areas with lower concentrations of wildfire-related PM2.5 are at an increased risk of these respiratory conditions. Consequently, there emerges a pressing global imperative to confront the escalating challenges presented by climate change and the intensifying menace of wildfires."
Impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on air pollution in Tbilisi.,"The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown provided a unique opportunity to assess the effects of mobility restrictions on urban air pollution. Prior studies have shown that scale and impact of these reductions varied by location and time. This study assessed how daily concentrations of PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ changed during 2020 lockdown compared to the same period in 2019 and 2021, and evaluated how these levels aligned with the updated WHO Air Quality Guidelines and Georgia's national standards. Daily average concentrations of PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ were analyzed over a 63-day period (March 21 to May 22) for 2019, 2020, and 2021. Descriptive statistics, ANOVA, and pairwise post-hoc tests were used to assess changes. Exceedance rates for WHO guidelines and Georgian standards were also calculated to evaluate compliance. Average daily concentrations of PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ declined modestly during the 2020 lockdown compared to pre-lockdown 2019, but increased significantly post-lockdown in 2021. PM₂.₅ increased from 11.7 µg/m3 in 2020 to 14.6 µg/m3 in 2021 (p = 0.010); PM₁₀ increased from 23.2 µg/m3 to 32.3 µg/m3 (p = 0.001). The proportion of days exceeding WHO values was lowest in 2020 for both PM₂.₅ (23.3%) and PM₁₀ (5.0%) but increased in 2021. Exceedances of Georgian standards remained minimal across all years. The lockdown was associated with a temporary decline in PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ in Tbilisi, however, levels increased again in 2021, with more frequent exceedances of WHO guidelines. The consistently low exceedance under Georgia's national standards highlights the urgency of revising thresholds and strengthening long-term air quality policies."
Health effects of wildfire PM2.5 in Latin American cities: A rapid systematic review and comparative synthesis.,"Wildfire activity is intensifying in Latin America due to climate and land-use changes, but the health impacts of wildfire-derived PM2.5 in urban areas remain poorly quantified and recognized. To assess the evidence on wildfire-related PM2.5 and its association with mortality and morbidity in Latin American cities. We conducted a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines, using data from PubMed, Scopus, and Bireme. One reviewer independently screened 163 articles and extracted data from 14 eligible studies. A risk of bias assessment was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Most studies were conducted in Brazil (n = 12) and used time-series or modelling designs to estimate health risks. Wildfire-specific PM2.5 exposure was associated with allcause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality. Reported effect estimates ranged from 1.7 to 7.7% increases in risk per 10 μg/m³ of exposure. Other studies assessed preterm birth, COVID-19 outcomes, and site-specific cancers. While two studies provided harmonized RR estimates for all-cause mortality, high heterogeneity and methodological differences prevented formal meta-analysis. Wildfire smoke contributes measurably to premature mortality in Latin America, but current evidence is unevenly distributed across regions, time periods, and population subgroups. Studies rarely capture the disproportionate risks faced by indigenous and rural communities or the intraurban disparities linked to poverty and geography. Future research should focus on the health burden of morbidity linked to wildfire PM2.5. La actividad de incendios forestales se está intensificando en América Latina debido al cambio climático y al uso del suelo, pero los impactos en la salud del material particulado fino (PM2.5) derivado de estos incendios en áreas urbanas siguen estando poco cuantificados y reconocidos. Evaluar la evidencia sobre el PM2.5 relacionado con incendios forestales y su asociación con la mortalidad y morbilidad en ciudades latinoamericanas. Se realizó una revisión sistemática rápida y un metaanálisis siguiendo las directrices PRISMA, utilizando datos de PubMed, Scopus y BIREME. Un revisor examinó de forma independiente 163 artículos y extrajo datos de 14 estudios elegibles. Se llevó a cabo una evaluación del riesgo de sesgo utilizando la escala de Newcastle–Ottawa. La mayoría de los estudios se realizaron en Brasil (n=12) y emplearon diseños de series temporales o modelos para estimar los riesgos para la salud. La exposición a PM2.5 específico de incendios se asoció con mortalidad por todas las causas, cardiovascular y respiratoria. Las estimaciones de efecto reportadas oscilaron entre aumentos del 1.7% al 7.7% en el riesgo por cada incremento de 10 µg/m³ de exposición. Otros estudios evaluaron parto prematuro, desenlaces por COVID-19 y cánceres específicos por sitio. Aunque dos estudios proporcionaron estimaciones armonizadas de riesgo relativo para la mortalidad por todas las causas, la alta heterogeneidad y las diferencias metodológicas impidieron realizar un meta-análisis formal. El humo de incendios forestales contribuye de manera significativa a la mortalidad prematura en América Latina, pero la evidencia actual está distribuida de forma desigual entre regiones, períodos de tiempo y subgrupos poblacionales. Rara vez se capturan los riesgos desproporcionados que enfrentan las comunidades indígenas y rurales, o las disparidades intraurbanas vinculadas a la pobreza y la geografía. Las investigaciones futuras deberían centrarse en la carga de morbilidad asociada al PM2.5 de incendios forestales."

Binding Multilateral Framework for South Asian Air Pollution Control: An Urgent Call for SAARC-UN Cooperation.,"South Asia's worsening air pollution crisis represents one of the most urgent public health and environmental challenges of the 21st century. Nearly two billion people-over one-quarter of the global population-reside in this region, where air quality levels routinely exceed World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines by factors of 10 to 15. This has translated into an unprecedented health burden, with approximately two million premature deaths annually, widespread chronic respiratory and cardiovascular disease, and rising economic losses. According to recent World Bank estimates, welfare losses amount to over 5% of regional GDP, a figure far exceeding the projected costs of coordinated mitigation. Despite this, South Asia continues to lack a binding regional framework capable of addressing its shared airshed. Existing cooperative efforts-such as the Malé Declaration on Control and Prevention of Air Pollution (1998)-have provided a useful platform for dialog and pilot monitoring, but they remain voluntary, under-resourced, and insufficient to manage the transboundary nature of the crisis. National-level programs, including India's National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), Bangladesh's National Air Quality Management Plan (NAQMP), and Nepal's National Air Quality Management Action Plan (AQMAP), demonstrate domestic commitment but are constrained by fragmentation, limited financing, and lack of regional integration. This gap represents the central knowledge and governance challenge that prompted the present commentary. To address it, we propose a dual-track architecture designed to institutionalize binding regional cooperation. Track A would establish a United Nations-anchored South Asian Transboundary Air Pollution Protocol, under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP). This protocol would codify legally enforceable emission standards, compliance committees, financial mechanisms, and harmonized monitoring. Track B would establish a South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Prime Ministers' Council on Air Quality (SPMCAQ) to provide political leadership, align domestic implementation, and authorize rapid responses to cross-border haze events. Lessons from the Indian Ocean Experiment, the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution, and Europe's Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution demonstrate that legally binding agreements combined with high-level political ownership can achieve durable reductions in pollution despite geopolitical tensions. By situating South Asia within these global precedents, the proposed framework provides a pragmatic, enforceable, and politically resilient pathway to protect health, reduce economic losses, and deliver cleaner air for nearly one-quarter of humanity."
Heterogeneous impact of fine particulate matter constituents on pulmonary tuberculosis onset: a multicenter time series study in Beijing.,"Epidemiological studies have implicated exposure to PM₂.₅ in the development of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB); however, the key constituents driving this effect have not been clearly identified. A time-series analysis spanning 2019 to 2023 was performed across several centers in Beijing to assess the links between major PM All five examined components demonstrated significant relationships with an elevated risk of PTB. Associations were not statistically significant on the same day (lag 0) or the next day (lag 1) after exposure. A clear risk increase was detected starting at a 2-day lag, which was no longer observable by lag 3. Per interquartile range (IQR) rise in the 3-day moving average (lag 0-2) of black carbon and organic matter, the relative risks (RRs) for PTB were 1.11 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03, 1.19] and 1.11 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.21), correspondingly. Together, these two components were the dominant drivers of the overall PM₂.₅ effect, contributing 41% and 39% of the joint risk, respectively. The results yield novel evidence that exposure to certain PM"
Clara cell secretory protein 16 protects against PM2.5-induced ferroptosis in mouse lung epithelial cells in a concentration-dependent manner.,"Background Clara cell secretory protein 16 (CC16) has been reported to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects. However, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the protective effect and mechanism of CC16 using an  TC-1 cells were exposed to PM2.5 to induce inflammatory injury and ferroptosis, followed by treatment with CC16 at different concentrations (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 µg/mL). TC-1 cells were divided into six groups: control, CC16, PM2.5, PM2.5 + CC16 (0.25 μg/mL), PM2.5 + CC16 (0.5 μg/mL), and PM2.5 + CC16 (1.0 μg/mL) groups. Cell viability was assessed using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Levels of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-5, IL-6, IL-13, IL-17A, and IL-1β) in the supernatant were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Protein expression levels of Nrf2, ACSL4, SLC7A11, and GPX4 were detected using western blotting. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected with a fluorescent probe, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was measured by JC-1 staining. Glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and Fe PM2.5 exposure significantly reduced cell viability, aggravated inflammation, induced ferroptosis, and disrupted the integrity of mouse pulmonary epithelial cells. CC16 treatment reversed these effects in a concentration-dependent manner. CC16 effectively mitigates PM2.5-induced cellular injury in mouse pulmonary epithelial cells through inhibition of ferroptosis, with its protective effect showing a clear concentration dependence. These findings suggest CC16 as a novel strategy for PM2.5-induced respiratory disease."
Effect of particulate matter (PM,"Air pollution, especially particulate matter (PM This time trend longitudinal study was conducted in the Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from July 2024 to December 2024. This study investigated the death and disability-adjusted life years (DALYS) rates of respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and total cancers caused by air pollution in the GCC region: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The data were collected from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) based on the Global Burden of Disease 2021 dataset from 1990 to 2021. In GCC states, the highest rate of PM exposure in 2021 was in Qatar (56.95 per 100 people), whereas the lowest was in Oman (38.86 per 100 people). Qatar consistently achieved the highest decreases in death and DALY rates from 1990 to 2021. Among all the diseases, diabetes mellitus was the only one that presented an increase in deaths and DALYS in the GCC region from 1990 to 2021. The rising trend in air pollutant exposure is attributable to death and DALY rates in GCC countries. GCC states are at risk due to air pollution and associated with high mortality and DALY rates for different diseases."
Air pollution exposure and the burden of pediatric upper respiratory tract infections in emergency departments: a retrospective time-series study.,"Upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) are a major public health problem and a leading cause of pediatric Emergency Department (ED) visits. Approximately 81% of emergency outpatient visits in children are due to URTI, and respiratory diseases account for 12% of all deaths worldwide. Air pollution is considered an important factor contributing to the increased incidence of respiratory infections. The aim of this study was to examine the association between ambient air pollutant concentrations and the number of pediatric ED admissions for URTI. We conducted a retrospective analysis including 2,572 children admitted to the ED between 2015 and 2020 with a diagnosis of URTI. Daily concentrations of particulate matter (PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO"
Black ginseng extract alleviates particulate matter-induced airway inflammation by suppressing the ROS/NLRP3/caspase-1 pathway in macrophages.,"Black ginseng extract (BGE) is a processed form of ginseng used in East Asian medicine to treat inflammatory respiratory diseases and is known for its excellent bioavailability and pharmacological efficacy. This study investigates the preventative effects and mechanisms of BGE against inflammatory lung damage caused by particulate matter (PM) in mouse alveolar macrophages (MH-S) and a mouse lung injury model. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and MH-S cell viability were assessed using DCFDA and the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, respectively. In Balb/c mice exposed to a combination of PM10 and diesel exhaust particles (PM/DEP), various cell types involved in immune cell infiltration were examined through Diff-Quik staining and flow cytometry. Lung histological changes were analyzed using hematoxylin and eosin, Masson's trichrome, and immunofluorescence staining. The molecular mechanism of BGE was investigated via Western blotting, caspase-1 activity assay, secretory/cleaved IL-1β ELISA, and real-time qPCR. In PM2.5-stimulated MH-S cells, BGE inhibits inflammation and cellular damage by decreasing ROS levels involved in the NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis. In mice exposed to a PM/DEP, BGE reduces immune cell influx (mainly neutrophils), inflammatory cytokine expression, and abnormal histopathological changes. Notably, BGE administration decreases macrophage activation markers, such as F4/80 and IL-1α, in PM/DEP-exposed lungs. BGE also suppresses the activity of the NLRP3/caspase-1 pathway in mice's lungs. BGE prevents inflammatory lung injury by decreasing ROS levels, thereby inactivating the NLRP3/caspase-1/pyroptosis pathway both in vitro and in vivo. This study highlights BGE's potential as a natural treatment for PM-induced lung inflammation."
Chemical injury history increases pulmonary susceptibility to PM2.5 inhalation: Toxicological evidence for risk assessment in a neglected vulnerable population.,"Environmental health risk assessments typically prioritize vulnerable populations such as the elderly, children, and individuals with respiratory diseases. However, individuals with a history of chemical-induced lung injury are rarely considered, despite potentially heightened sensitivity to air pollutants. Therefore, this study investigated the pulmonary health risks of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 exposure in a chemical lung injury model, reflecting realistic exposure conditions. Mice were intratracheally administered polyhexamethylene guanidine phosphate (PHMG-P; 0.3 mg/kg), followed by nose-only exposure to PM2.5 (8.88 ± 1.77 mg/m"

MUC1 alleviates PM2.5-induced airway inflammation by inhibiting the IRAK4/NF-κB/NLRP3 mediated pyroptosis in airway epithelial cells.,"Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) triggers airway inflammation through the activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway, contributing to the pathogenesis of various acute and chronic respiratory diseases. Mucin 1 (MUC1), a transmembrane glycoprotein highly expressed on airway epithelial cells, is known to modulate TLR-mediated inflammatory responses. However, the specific role and molecular mechanism by which MUC1 regulates PM2.5-induced airway inflammation remain inadequately understood. Lung injury models were established using Muc1 PM2.5 exposure caused notable epithelial disruption, inflammatory infiltration, and submucosal fibrosis in Muc1 MUC1 is upregulated in airway epithelial cells upon PM2.5 exposure and serves as a key endogenous inhibitor of airway inflammation. It exerts its anti-inflammatory and anti-pyroptotic effects by suppressing IRAK4 phosphorylation, thereby modulating downstream NF-κB/NLRP3/GSDMD signaling. These findings highlight MUC1 as a potential therapeutic target for PM2.5-induced airway inflammatory diseases."
Dynamic associations between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and respiratory-cardiovascular diseases: A trajectory analysis of a prospective study.,"Exposure to ambient air pollution constitutes a significant risk factor for both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, its impact on the progression of respiratory-cardiovascular disease trajectories, particularly among individuals with COPD, remains unclear. This study aims to assess the associations of long-term air pollution exposure with the progression from a healthy state to the development of COPD, subsequent CVD, and mortality, utilizing a multi-state modeling framework. We included 318,282 participants from the UK Biobank who were free of COPD and CVD at baseline in this prospective cohort study. Annual average concentrations of particulate matter (PM₂.₅, PM₁₀) and nitrogen oxides (NO₂, NOₓ), derived from participant residential histories and data from the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), were used to estimate long-term exposure. Multi-state models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for each 1 µg/m³ increase in air pollutant concentration in relation to disease transitions along the respiratory-cardiovascular trajectory. During a median follow-up period of 13.5 years, 6901 participants developed COPD; 2207 of whom subsequently developed CVD, and 15,921 participants died. All pollutants were significantly associated with adverse transitions in the respiratory-cardiovascular disease trajectory, Adjusted HRs (95 % CIs) per 1 µg/m³ increase in pollutant exposure for the transition from COPD to CVD were: NO Chronic exposure to ambient air pollution, particularly PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀, is linked to an elevated risk of progression from COPD to CVD, thereby augmenting the overall burden of respiratory-cardiovascular diseases. These findings highlight the urgent need for effective air quality interventions to reduce pollution-related health impacts."
Exposure to Household Air Pollution From Biomass Cooking and Severe Pneumonia in Infants.,"Household air pollution from biomass cooking is considered an important risk factor for child pneumonia. To evaluate the longitudinal association between exposure to particulate matter with a diameter of less than or equal to 2.5 µm (PM2.5) or carbon monoxide (CO) and severe pneumonia in infants. This cohort study included infants (aged ≤12 months) whose mothers participated in a 4-country randomized clinical trial. Conducted from May 2018 to September 2021, the trial tested whether an 18-month liquefied petroleum gas stove and fuel distribution intervention reduced the incidence of severe pneumonia in offspring during infancy when compared with biomass cooking. The trial was conducted in communities where residents cooked primarily with biomass fuels in Guatemala, India, Peru, and Rwanda. Data analysis was conducted from December 2024 to July 2025. Twenty-four hour personal exposure to PM2.5 and CO was measured 3 times during pregnancy and 3 times during infancy. In this exposure-response analysis, severe pneumonia cases were identified using respiratory signs and symptoms with confirmation of consolidation by imaging and hypoxemia by pulse oximetry. The longitudinal association between severe pneumonia in infants and PM2.5 or CO exposures by infant-quarters, adjusted for confounders, was modeled. Overall, 3061 infants (48.2% girls; mean [SD] gestational age at birth, 39.3 [1.7] weeks) contributed 11 996 infant-quarters and 13 910 measurements of personal PM2.5 exposures (range, 5.4-1182.0 µg/m3). A total of 175 episodes of severe pneumonia were identified in 160 infants. Those with at least 1 episode of severe pneumonia had similar mean (SD) prenatal (101 [100] µg/m3 vs 88 [80] µg/m3; P = .11) and postnatal (70 [78] µg/m3 vs 67 [93] µg/m3; P = .68) PM2.5 exposures when compared with infants without severe pneumonia. There were no associations between prenatal (adjusted risk ratio [RR], 1.03; 95% CI, 0.94-1.13) or postnatal (adjusted RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87-1.09) PM2.5 exposures and severe pneumonia or between CO exposures and severe pneumonia. In this cohort study with exposure-response analysis, there was no evidence of an association between longitudinal PM2.5 or CO exposures and severe pneumonia in infants. Taken with the intention-to-treat analysis from the randomized clinical trial, these results challenge prior research suggesting that PM2.5 or CO exposures from biomass cooking are an important risk factor for severe pneumonia in infants."
Analysis of the correlation between PM,"This study aimed to analyze the epidemiological characteristics of severe Mycoplasma pneumoniae in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of Hunan Children's Hospital from 2020 to 2023. This study investigated the epidemiological patterns related to different years, seasons, ages, and sexes, as well as the correlations of PM"
Pseudohypoxia induced by chemical pollutants: Biochemical evidence of environmental vulnerability.,"Chemical pollutants can abnormally elevate hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) levels under normoxic conditions, leading to pseudohypoxia. This condition disrupts normal cellular energy metabolism, gene expression, and signal transduction, thereby inducing detrimental physiological effects. Pseudohypoxia can also increase the risk of various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic respiratory diseases, while adversely affecting disease treatment and prognosis. Focusing on the intersection between environmental pollution and hypoxia signaling pathways, this review proposes a novel concept that chemical pollutants can induce pseudohypoxia and elucidates its underlying mechanisms. We also identify various environmental pollutants that induce pseudohypoxia, including but not limited to metals and metalloids (e.g., cadmium, cobalt, arsenic), persistent organic pollutants (e.g., BPA, dioxins, PCBs), and atmospheric particulate pollutants (e.g., PM2.5, diesel exhaust particles), and examine the complex interplay between these pollutants, pseudohypoxia, and various diseases. This review aims to offer novel strategies for managing pseudohypoxia caused by environmental exposures, thereby offering new insights into the prevention and treatment of environmental exposure-related disease and susceptibility."
"Association between outdoor air pollution and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Xinjiang, China.","This study investigated the association between short-term exposure to air pollutants and hospital admissions for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) in Northwest China. We analyzed data from a tertiary hospital in Xinjiang (2014-2023), along with air pollutant and meteorological data. Using a time-series approach with generalized additive models and distributed lag nonlinear models, we found that interquartile range increases in PM₂.₅, PM₁₀, NO₂, CO, and O₃ were associated with increased AECOPD admissions of 4.70% (95% CI: 1.48%, 8.01%), 1.61% (0.38%, 2.86%), 15.97% (7.36%, 25.28%), 35.64% (15.84%, 58.82%), and 5.89% (1.10%, 10.90%), respectively, with peak effects at lag 0. Stratified analyses identified sex-, age-, and season-specific relationships, including protective effects of O₃ and CO in males at longer lags, heightened susceptibility to particulate matter and NO₂ in adults aged ≥65 years, and distinct seasonal patterns for NO₂, O₃, and CO. These findings demonstrate that short-term air pollution exposure is significantly associated with AECOPD hospitalizations in this understudied region."
Greater lung cancer polygenic risk score in higher air pollution areas linked to greater rate of lung adenocarcinoma: a single-centre study in East Asia.,"Lung cancer, a leading cause of cancer deaths, is influenced by smoking, air pollution and genetic factors. This study investigated the association between lung cancer polygenic risk score (PRS) and air pollution in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cases in East Asia. This Taiwanese case-control study included 57 257 participants, of whom 1059 were diagnosed with lung cancer and 857 had LUAD. Excluding individuals with missing PRS data, the final study group comprised 648 LUAD patients and 6480 age- and gender-matched controls. Logistic regression models were employed to assess the association between PRS and LUAD risk, and interaction effects between PRS and particulate matter (PM2.5/PM10) exposure were evaluated. PGS000070 demonstrated an OR of 2.796 (95% CI 2.236 to 3.497, p<0.001), while PGS000392 exhibited an OR of 1.938 (95% CI 1.559 to 2.409, p<0.001). Higher PM exposure increased LUAD risk among individuals in the highest quartile (Q4) of both PRSs compared with the lowest quartile (Q1). In the smoking subgroup, individuals in Q4 for PGS000070 showed significantly heightened LUAD risk when exposed to higher PM2.5 and PM10 levels, with ORs of 4.08 (p<0.0001) and 2.897 (p<0.0001), respectively. However, the interaction effect of PRS (PGS000070 and PGS000392) and PM exposure on LUAD risk was not statistically significant. This hospital-based study indicated that LUAD patients had higher PRSs and greater exposure to PM. However, the interaction effect between PRS (PGS000070 and PGS000392) and PM exposure on LUAD risk was not statistically significant, suggesting these factors act independently. The accumulation of air pollution did not show a gradual increase in LUAD risk. Notably, the association between PRS and air pollution was more pronounced in the smoking subgroup for PGS000070 but not for PGS000392."
Modifying effects of PM,"Extreme heat is a critical public health threat, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. While its direct health impacts are well documented, less is known about how air pollution modifies heat-related risks. We analyzed daily hospital admissions for circulatory and respiratory diseases in Brazil (2008-2018), combined with high-resolution temperature and pollution (PM₂.₅ and O₃) data. Using generalized additive models and random-effects meta-analysis, we found that PM₂.₅ consistently amplified the effect of heat on respiratory admissions, with a 20.1% increase in risk under high PM₂.₅ conditions (95% CI 4.8-35.4%). In contrast, O₃ showed heterogeneous effects, including a national-level protective association at high concentrations (- 7.6%, 95% CI - 9.6 to - 5.6%). Regional analyses revealed stronger interactions in the North and Southeast. These findings indicate that PM₂.₅ exacerbates, and O₃ variably modifies, heat-related hospitalizations in Brazil, underscoring the need for regionally tailored adaptation and air quality policies."
The Joint Effects of Extreme Heat and Wildfire Smoke on Paediatric Acute Care Utilisation.,"As climate change worsens, instances of combined extreme heat and wildfire smoke events are becoming more frequent. Despite their increased vulnerability, investigations on the joint effect of wildfire smoke and extreme heat on children's health are limited. To investigate the joint effects of extreme heat and wildfire smoke on paediatric acute care utilisation (ACU) in California from 2006 to 2019. In this case-crossover analysis, we assembled a time-series dataset of warm seasons, (May-September) for 1772 ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) in California from 2006 to 2019 to evaluate daily ACUs in the paediatric population (0-19 years). For wildfire smoke, we identified ZCTA-days exposed using a previously developed time-series dataset. For extreme heat, we calculated the daily ZCTA-specific maximum heat index. There were four exposure types: exposed to extreme heat alone, exposed to wildfire smoke alone, exposed to both events simultaneously (compound event) and not exposed to either event. We quantified the synergistic effects by comparing a child's exposures on the day when an ACU occurred to the child's exposure during control days. We found 1100-105,788 ZCTA-days where exposure to both extreme heat and wildfire smoke events occurred across eight combinations of event definitions. The relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) ranged up to 0.11 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.03, 0.19) with thresholds of the 95th percentile for extreme heat and 35 μg/m Investigating the synergistic effects of extreme heat and wildfire smoke events in paediatric populations is necessary to develop effective health protection strategies."
Trends in PM₂.₅ and mortality risks in an industrial District of Taiwan: a 12-year analysis.,"Ambient air pollution, particularly fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅), poses a major global public health concern. We examined trends in all-cause and respiratory disease-specific mortality and their association with PM₂.₅ concentrations during three time periods (2008-2011, 2012-2015, 2016-2019) in Linyuan District, Kaohsiung City, and Taiwan, using generalized Poisson mixed models. PM₂.₅ concentrations declined by 23.6% in Taiwan, from 24.5 µg/m"
Effects of PM2.5 Reduction Interventions on Cardiovascular Indicators: A Meta-analysis.,"Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, but the effectiveness of individual-level interventions to reduce exposure remains unclear. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the effects of four distinct categories of PM2.5 interventions on cardiovascular health including high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, respiratory protective equipment, improved cookstoves, and other behavioral PM2.5 reduction methods. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane library for studies published between December 2002 and March 2025 that reported the cardiovascular effect of PM2.5 reduction. Intervention methods were categorized based on their mechanisms of action and implementation settings. The primary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), with secondary outcomes including endothelial function indices, heart rate variability (HRV), and inflammatory markers. A total of 72 trials involving 6,063 participants (age range: 12.4-82 years) were included. Overall, PM2.5 reduction interventions significantly decreased SBP by 1.97 mmHg (95% CI: -2.89, -1.05) and DBP by 1.08 mmHg (95% CI: -1.80, -0.35). Among secondary outcomes, C-reactive protein (CRP) decreased significantly (MD = -0.03mg/dl, 95% CI: -0.06, -0.00, P = 0.042), while no significant changes were observed in interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), or HRV. Subgroup analyses revealed differential effects by intervention type: Air filtration interventions showed the largest effect on SBP (MD = -1.94mmHg, 95% CI: -3.33, -0.55, P = 0.006) compared to other interventions. These findings suggest that PM2.5 reduction interventions could lower blood pressure and reduce markers of systemic inflammation, indicating that personal-level interventions may provide measurable cardiovascular benefits, even with short-term implementation."
Seasonal and COVID-19 lockdown variations in PM,"To investigate seasonal and COVID-19-lockdown variations in PM2.5 chemical composition in Taipei and the effects of those compositional differences on lung cell toxicity. PM2.5 was collected in warm (2021/07-2021/08) and cold (2021/11-2022/02) seasons and during LV2/LV3 COVID-19 alert periods. Composition (metals, PAHs) was analyzed and A549 and PC9 lung cells were exposed to equal mass concentrations (0-100 μg/mL) of extracted PM2.5. Cell viability, ROS, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential and GSH/GPX4 were measured. At equivalent mass concentrations (50 μg/mL), warm-season PM2.5 induced higher ROS and greater reduction in viability than cold-season PM2.5. LV2-period PM2.5 contained higher metal content and caused more severe cellular damage than LV3. Spearman correlation plus single-compound assays identified cadmium and Dibenzo[a,e]pyrene as components strongly associated with cytotoxicity. Seasonal and human-activity driven compositional changes-rather than mass concentration alone-affect PM2.5 toxicity in vitro; these results underscore the importance of controlling specific chemical emissions."
The burden and risk factors of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Asia and its countries from 1990 to 2021: a systematic analysis based on the 2021 global burden of disease study.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. In Asia, risk exposures such as smoking and ambient PM₂.₅ are prevalent, and regional differences are significant. This has led to the COPD disease burden in this region being at a relatively high level globally. Based on this, this study conducts a systematic assessment of the COPD disease burden in Asia. Data on incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study. The analysis incorporated the Sociodemographic Index (SDI) and included stratification by sex and age to reveal the distribution and disparities in the burden of COPD across populations. Joinpoint regression models were used to calculate the annual percent change (APC) and average annual percent change (AAPC) to estimate temporal trends. In addition, major attributable risk factors for COPD were analyzed to identify key drivers of disease burden across regions and populations. In 2021, the number of COPD cases in Asia reached 10,512,843 (95% UI: 9,610,006-11,432,970), with an age-standardized incidence rate of 210.79 per 100,000 persons (95% UI: 193.52-227.94). COPD accounted for 2,885,059 deaths (95% UI: 2,571,267-3,218,689), corresponding to an age-standardized mortality rate of 64.10 per 100,000 persons (95% UI: 56.74-71.66). The total DALYs were 60,507,100 (95% UI: 55,319,463-66,518,282), with an age-standardized rate of 1,253.15 per 100,000 persons (95% UI: 1,148.26-1,376.29). Among Asian subregions, South Asia bore the heaviest burden of COPD. Major risk factors included particulate matter (PM) pollution, smoking, secondhand smoke, and occupational exposure to particulate matter, gases, and fumes (OP-MGF). This study highlights the substantial COPD burden in Asia, with air pollution, smoking, and occupational exposures being the predominant risk factors. Targeted public health interventions are urgently needed to mitigate the COPD burden and improve overall health outcomes in the region."
The impact of systemic inflammatory markers on EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer.,"High prevalence of EGFRm lung cancer was found in the Asian population. Preclinical data suggest that inflammatory cytokines activated by PM2.5 affected EGFRm clone expansion. Here, we explored the correlation between inflammatory markers and EGFRm NSCLC. Resected NSCLC patients (2016-2023) were enrolled. Tumor tissues and blood serum were retrieved from Ramathibodi tumor biobank. EGFR 19del and L858R mutations were performed by rt-PCR in cancerous tissue and dPCR in normal tissue in the same patient. NF-Kb and STAT3 protein signaling were measured by ELISA in both cancerous and normal tissue. Cytokines (IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 and TNF-α) were explored in serum by flow cytometry. Among 140 patients, EGFRm prevalence was 58% in cancerous tissue but only 5% in normal tissue. NF-kB and STAT3 were statistically higher in cancerous tissue than normal tissue [NF-kB median O.D.=0.82 (IQR; 0.07-2.82) vs. 0.32 (IQR; 0.05-2.48), P < 0.001; STAT3 median O.D.=0.32 (IQR; 0.10-1.58) vs. 0.17 (IQR; 0.06-1.29, P < 0.001]. STAT3 was significantly increased in EGFRm compared to EGFRwt [median O.D.=0.36 (IQR; 0.234-0.592) vs. 0.23 (IQR; 0.158-0.409), OR = 11.09 (95% CI; 2.17-56.58), P = 0.004]. TNF-α, IL-10, and STAT3 in cancer cells were higher in EGFRm than EGFRwt (P = 0.003, 0.008, and < 0.001, respectively). None of cytokines was statistically different between EGFRm and EGFRwt patients. However, only STAT3 in cancer cells and non-smoker were associated with EGFRm NSCLC in multivariable analysis. Inflammation could be one of the pathogenesis of both NSCLC and EGFRm lung cancer as we demonstrated in our pilot study. STAT3 is a potentially inflammatory-predictive biomarkers. Larger cohort is needed."
Impact of long-term exposure to PM,Epidemiological evidence indicates a close association between particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of fewer than 2.5 μm (PM This study used data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) from 2011 to 2018 to explore the relationship between long-term exposure to PM Results reveal a significant positive correlation between long-term exposure to PM This prospective cohort study of middle-aged and older adults in China observed that long-term exposure to various PM
Exposure to living environmental risk factors and incidence of chronic lung disease in Chinese adults: results from a cross-sectional and longitudinal study.,"Chronic lung disease (CLD) imposes substantial health burdens on Chinese adults. While prior studies have focused on isolated environmental factors, this study comprehensively evaluated the synergistic effects of living environmental risk factors (LEFs), including indoor fuel type, water source, exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), housing conditions, and indoor temperature/humidity, on CLD development. Utilizing data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS, 2011-2018), cross-sectional (n = 12,318) and longitudinal (n = 8,516) analyses were conducted. LEFs score were derived from multi-domain environmental metrics. Logistic regression was used to identify baseline associations between LEFs and CLD, while Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate longitudinal risks. Adjusted covariates included sociodemographic, lifestyle, comorbidities, and regional factors. Poor quality of the living environment was significantly correlated with CLD prevalence (cross-sectional OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.03-1.27) and incidence (longitudinal HR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.10-1.42) after full adjustment. Key risk factors included indoor solid fuel use, unsuitable indoor temperature, and excessive humidity. Subgroup analyses highlighted stronger associations among rural residents and individuals with comorbidities. Integrated assessment of environmental risks is critical for CLD prevention. Mitigating indoor air pollution, optimizing thermal conditions, and improving housing quality may reduce disease burden. Public health policies should prioritize multifaceted environmental interventions for high-risk populations."
Progressive lung fibrosis in aged mice induced by repetitive bleomycin: Exacerbation by long-term PM₂.₅ inhalation.,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal interstitial lung disease marked by spatially and temporally heterogeneous fibrotic remodeling. Although epidemiological studies suggest that prolonged exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) accelerates IPF progression, the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect remain poorly defined. The objective of this study was to establish an experimental model that better reflects the chronicity and pathological complexity of IPF. To this end, we developed a repetitive low-dose bleomycin (BLM) model in aged mice and subjected them to long-term PM2.5 inhalation. This approach induced sustained fibrosis with histological features resembling usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), including alveolar epithelial hyperplasia, bronchiolar metaplasia, cystic remodeling, and fibroblastic foci. Transcriptomic profiling revealed extensive gene expression reprogramming, with a greater overlap with human IPF signatures than observed in the single-dose model. Notably, 27.5 % of differentially expressed genes were shared with human IPF lungs, particularly those involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, epithelial repair, and immune modulation. PM2.5 exposure further exacerbated fibrotic remodeling, reduced survival, and increased fibrotic marker expression. Additional transcriptomic analysis identified PM2.5-specific gene signatures enriched in mitotic dysregulation, chromatin remodeling, and epithelial stress responses, with key hub genes such as BNIP3, SERPINE1, and BIRC5. In conclusion, our repetitive BLM model in aged mice effectively recapitulates the histopathological and molecular landscape of IPF and provides a physiologically relevant platform for studying chronic fibrogenesis. This model also enables mechanistic investigation of environmental exacerbators such as PM2.5, offering new insights into gene-environment interactions that drive pollutant-induced fibrotic progression."
Association of lung silica deposition with epidermal growth factor receptor-mutant lung cancer.,"Exposure to particulate matter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5), which comprises various components, has been implicated in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-driven lung cancer development. The silica can be inhaled non-occupationally as PM2.5, particularly that derived from Asian dust in East Asia. This retrospective cross-sectional study investigated consecutive patients with surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma tested for EGFR mutations during 2020-2022. Silica particles in the resected lungs were counted via polarized light microscopy. Patients were categorized into high- and low-silica groups according to the cutoff value of the number of silica deposits. We conducted receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for EGFR mutation status according to silica deposit levels. We compared EGFR mutation profiles and performed logistic regression model analysis. Of the 174 patients, only three had an occupational silica-exposure history. The median numbers of silica deposits in 20 microscopic fields-of-view were 26.0 and 9.0 particles in patients with and without EGFR mutations, respectively (P < 0.001). EGFR mutations occurred in 66.7 % and 30.4 % of participants in the high- (n = 72) and low-silica groups (n = 102), respectively (P < 0.001). The Cochran-Armitage trend test showed a significant linear trend for higher silica deposition with a higher prevalence of EGFR mutations (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that high silica deposition was independently associated with EGFR mutations (adjusted odds ratio, 3.20; 95 % confidence interval, 1.49-6.88; P = 0.003). Silica can be deposited in the lungs even without occupational exposure and is associated with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma."
DALYs-Based Health Risk Assessment and Key Influencing Factors of PM,The health risks of PM
Dynamic airborne mycobiome in the metropolitan city transit system is driven by seasonality and station type.,"Subway transit systems serve as the primary transportation mode in metropolitan areas. The quality of the airway in transit plays a crucial role in human health as commuters and workers are exposed to microbes transmitted from passengers and circulated within built environments. The diversity and dynamics of bacterial microbiome in these environments have been relatively well studied. However, the fungal communities remain poorly investigated. In this study, we conducted a year-long comprehensive investigation of the mycobiomes within the world's second largest subway system and analyzed the seasonal dynamics of fungal composition across intercity hub stations, urban hub stations, and suburban stations. We found a high diversity of the subway mycobiome that varied seasonally and was influenced by various environmental factors, such as particulate matter (PM2.5) levels and average humidity. Fungal diversity was higher in months with elevated PM2.5 pollution. Autumn exhibited increased diversity and peaks in the distribution of human pathogenic fungi. Furthermore, it was determined that station types exert a significant influence on the diversity of pathogenic fungi, with interchange stations (train and airport transfer stations) showing the highest diversity, while suburban stations showed the lowest. The core taxa of the mycobiome comprised several genera including ubiquitous fungi commonly found in soil and outdoor environments (e.g.,  Respiratory infections and allergic reactions caused by airborne fungi have received considerable public attention; however, fungal communities remain poorly investigated. This research performed the first year-long investigation of airborne mycobiome in the world's largest subway system. We found that the fungal diversity peaks in autumn and at stations with higher PM2.5 levels. Intercity hubs exhibit the highest diversity of pathogenic fungi and the least seasonal fluctuation. Suburban stations revealed a reduced diversity of human pathogens but an elevated presence of plant pathogens. Core fungal taxa in subways include both common soil fungi (e.g., "
"PM2.5-Related Burden of Tracheal, Bronchial, and Lung Cancer in China, the United States, Japan, and South Korea (1990-2021).","To quantify the tracheal, bronchial, and lung cancer burden attributable to particulate matter pollution in selected countries, and thereby provide evidence for context - specific public health interventions. Based on Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 data,we appliedJoinPoint to analyze the temporal trends from 1990-2021 in the burden of PM2.5 - attributable tracheal, bronchial, and lung (TBL) cancer in China, the US, Japan, and South Korea. And we explored the age, period, cohort effects and predicted future trends using the age-period-cohort mode and Bayesian analysis. Globally, the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) for TBL cancers due to PM2.5 exposure showed a declining trend with an average annual percentage change (AAPC) of-1.2811 from1990 to 2021, projections suggest continued decreases in ASMR in selected countries over the next 29 years, but a global increase is expected. Studies have demonstrated a global decline in the mortality burden attributed to bronchogenic carcinoma linked to PM2.5. Nevertheless, future projections indicate that the global burden of air pollution-related TBL cancer will rise, effective public health strategies are urgent to develop."
"Impact of short-term exposure to ambient air pollution on cardiovascular disease outpatient visits: a time-series study in Yichang, China.","Rapid industrialization has exacerbated ambient air pollution in Yichang, China, posing cardiovascular health risks. This study evaluates the short-term impact of ambient air pollutants on cardiovascular disease (CVD) outpatient visits and assesses the effectiveness of environmental policies implemented post-2018. We analyzed 510,831 CVD outpatient records alongside daily concentrations of PM Short-term exposure to NO₂ (lag05, RR = 1.253, 95% CI: 1.192-1.317), SO₂ (lag0, RR = 1.053, 95% CI: 1.011-1.096), and CO (lag01, RR = 1.063, 95% CI: 1.016-1.111) was significantly associated with increased cardiovascular disease outpatient visits. Concentrations of five major ambient air pollutants (excluding O₃) showed significant reductions after 2018 (P < 0.001). The associations of SO₂, CO, and PM₁₀ with CVD visits were attenuated after 2018. NO₂ effects were stronger in colder seasons and remained robust in two-pollutant models. No statistically significant associations were observed for PM₂.₅, PM₁₀, and O₃. Short-term exposure to NO₂, SO₂, and CO demonstrated statistically significant positive associations with cardiovascular disease outpatient visits. Environmental policies reduced ambient air pollutant levels and attenuated health impacts, supporting continued air quality interventions."
Toward the application of metallothionein inducers as a method of prevention of air pollutant-dependent lung injury.,"Although Sustainable Development Goal 3.9 states the global goal of reducing air pollution-related death and disease, innovative ways to reduce air pollution-related deaths and diseases have not yet been established.

"Effects of Daikin air purifiers on asthma control and pulmonary function: A multicenter, single-arm, observational pilot study.","While numerous studies, including systematic reviews, have investigated the effects of air purifiers on asthma control in Western countries, there is a paucity of research conducted in Japan. This multicenter, single-arm, observational pilot study examined the effect of air purifiers on asthma control in Japanese patients. This study was conducted at the Kyoto University Hospital and the Ayabe City Hospital. The air purifiers (MCK704ABK: Daikin Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) were equipped with electrostatic high-efficiency particulate air filters, capable of capturing 99.97 % of particles ≥0.3 μm. We examined changes in particulate matter (PM) 2.5 levels and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV Eighteen patients (median age: 64 [58, 70] years, 66.7 % female) participated in the study. The median PM2.5 concentration significantly decreased from 4.6 (3.4, 6.9) μg/m The Daikin air purifiers demonstrated the potential to reduce PM levels and improve pulmonary function and asthma symptoms."
PM2.5 induces ferroptosis in chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases ,
Particulate matter and exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: analysis of emergency department visits in a low-pollution area.,"To evaluate the association between particulate matter concentration (PM10 and PM2.5) and the number of emergency department visits for exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in a low-pollution area. We conducted an ecological study based on emergency department visits for COPD exacerbations. A generalized additive model was used to estimate the relative risk and attributable fraction (AF), adjusting for weather variables. Pollution levels on the day of the visit and the 5 preceding days were considered to assess potential delayed effects of exposure. A total of 2,045 patients with 5,233 emergency department visits were included. A total of 79.1% of the patients were men. The mean age was 79.5 years (SD, 10.1). The mean concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 was 11.5 µg/m³ and 17.3 µg/m³, respectively. Both emergency visits and particulate matter concentrations showed a seasonalpattern. A significant association was found with exposure occurring 3 days prior (lag -3), with a 5.8% increase in visits for every 10 µg/m³ increase in PM2.5 (AF 5.45%) and a 3.3% increase for PM10 (AF 3.15%). Men and patients older than 75 years showed greater sensitivity to exposure. The impact of particulate matter was more pronounced during the summer months. Exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 is associated with an increase in emergency department visits for COPD exacerbations, with a particular impact among men, patients older than 75 years, and during the summer season.

Se encontró una asociación significativa con la exposición ocurrida en los 3 días previos (lag –3) con incremento del 5,8% en las consultas por cada aumento de 10 μg/m3 de PM2,5 (FA 5,45 %) y del 3,3 % para PM10 (FA 3,15%). Los hombres y pacientes mayores de 75 años presentaron una mayor sensibilidad a la exposición. El impacto del material particulado fue más intenso en los meses de verano. La exposición a PM2,5 y PM10 se asocia con un aumento de las consultas a urgencias por exacerbación de EPOC, con especial incidencia en varones, pacientes de más de 75 años y en la estación de verano."
Early life exposure to ambient particulate matter and Kawasaki disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Though numerous air pollutants have been mechanistically associated with inflammation and vascular morbidity, particulate matter (PM) is one of the pollutants with the strongest association. However, PM is generally categorized according to aerodynamic diameters between 2.5 and 10 μg m A systematic search was conducted using PubMed and EMBASE. Studies with PM included as a predictor, and Kawasaki disease as an outcome were included. This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The risk of bias in the selected studies was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Eleven studies met the criteria for inclusion. All studies suggested an association between exposure to PM and increase risk or exacerbation of KD, though not all results reached statistical significance. Due to significant heterogeneity, pooled analyses were possible only in select studies for pre- and postnatal PM Particulate matter exposure is associated with an increased risk of developing and exacerbating KD, especially in populations experiencing temporary increased sensitivity and in populations with preexisting inflammatory diseases. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42023468937, PROSPERO CRD42023468937."
Wildfire Exposure and Respiratory Health: A Comprehensive Review of Emerging Evidence.,"In January 2025, a catastrophic wildfire in Los Angeles, California, resulted in extensive economic losses and created a substantial risk to public respiratory health. With the progression of climate change, the increasing frequency and severity of wildfires have become a critical global issue due to their substantial impact on respiratory health. Wildfire smoke comprises elevated levels of ambient air pollutants, such as particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (O3), and a range of toxic substances. Notably, wildfire-related PM is especially detrimental because it can penetrate deeply into the lower respiratory tract and alveoli, provoking stronger oxidative and inflammatory responses, and leading to both the development and worsening of respiratory conditions, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Research indicates that short-term exposure to wildfire smoke is linked to acute exacerbations of asthma, COPD, and pneumonia, contributing to higher mortality rates and increased demands on healthcare utilization. Long-term exposure may increase the risk of developing COPD, accelerate disease progression, and is potentially linked to a heightened risk of lung cancer and mortality. Collectively, these data underscore the substantial threat posed by wildfire smoke, escalating morbidity, mortality, and socioeconomic burdens. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in our understanding of respiratory health impacts linked with wildfire smoke exposure. By aggregating current evidence, the review seeks to guide healthcare practitioners and public health officials, thereby promoting evidence-based interventions for clinical management, health communication, and disaster response amid the escalating risk associated with wildfires."
Immunosuppression induced by co-exposure to allergens and PM2.5 increases the risk of lung disease upon viral protein challenge.,"Particulate matter (PM2.5) and allergens are common environmental exposures. However, their combined effects and their risks are still poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the impact of co-exposure to house dust mites (HDM) allergens and diesel exhaust particles (DEP) on lung immune responses, and assess the susceptibility to viral protein. We found that compared with HDM alone, mice co-exposed to HDM and DEP showed DEP-phagocytosed macrophages in lungs and did not show asthma phenotypes, including T helper 2 (Th2) response, eosinophilic inflammation, mucus production, and serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) production. Mechanistically, DEP induced an immunosuppressive state by suppressing HDM-induced Th2 responses by reducing FcγRIIB and FcγRIII-mediated phagocytosis and antigen presentation in the lungs. Notably, short-term exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunit 1 (S1) in altered immune environment led to the development of pulmonary fibrosis. This was accompanied by elevated transforming growth factor-β"
"Impact of black carbon exposure on length of hospital stay in asthma patients: a retrospective cohort study in yulin, China.","BACKGROUND: While PM₂.₅ exposure is linked to asthma exacerbations, components-specific effects on healthcare burden remain understudied. Hospital length of stay (LOS), a critical indicator of disease severity and healthcare costs, has received limited attention in black carbon (BC) research. To quantify the association between short-term exposure to PM₂.₅ components-particularly black carbon (BC)-and LOS among asthma patients, and to identify vulnerable populations and critical exposure windows. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 4,509 asthma patients (ICD-10: J45 ~ J46) hospitalized in Yulin, China (2018 ~ 2023). Daily PM Each 1.00 µg/m³ increase in BC concentration at lag9 significantly associated with a 0.45-days prolongation in hospital stay (95%CI: 0.12 ~ 0.78). Age-stratified analysis revealed heightened vulnerability in children (effect observed at lag1 ~ 3, lag7 ~ 9) and middle-aged adults (sustained effects lag2 ~ 10), while elderly patients showed no significant associations. Seasonal analysis demonstrated that BC effects were more pronounced during non-pollen season (0.77 additional days per 1.00 µg/m³ increase), with no significant effects during pollen season. Restricted cubic spline analysis confirmed dose-response relationships, with effects plateauing at BC concentrations ≥ 1.98 µg/m³. Short-term BC exposure was significantly associated with extend asthma hospitalization duration, with critical exposure windows at lag9 and pronounced vulnerability in children and middle-aged adults during non-pollen seasons. These findings provide quantitative evidence supporting BC-specific emission controls in air quality policies and highlight the need for targeted protection of vulnerable populations, particularly in high-population regions."
Ecological assessment of extreme temperature and fine particulate matter (pm2.5) impact on diabetes service and outcomes in Thailand.,"Environmental changes, such as extreme heat and air pollution, are assumed to exacerbate chronic conditions like diabetes and increase demand for related health services. This study investigates how daily maximum temperature and air pollution affect diabetes service utilization in Thailand. Using ecological analysis, national diabetes service data from the Thai Ministry of Public Health and ERA5 LAND satellite data (from 2018 to 2023) were examined. The data included 2-meter ambient temperature and particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations, adjusted for health system variables, aggregated risk factors, the COVID-19 outbreak response, and spatiotemporal correlations. A generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) was employed to assess the effects of maximum temperature and PM2.5 on diabetes screening and the proportion of patients with controlled blood glucose. The analysis revealed an annual average maximum temperature of 38.6 °C and an average PM2.5 concentration of 21.6 µg/m³. National diabetes screening was 87% of the target, and only 30% of diagnosed patients achieved the recommended blood glucose levels. Maximum temperature was found to non-linearly reduce diabetes screening, particularly between 31.6 °C and 41.9 °C, while no significant association was observed with PM2.5 levels. Temperatures above 32.7 °C were associated with lower proportions of patients achieving recommended blood sugar levels, while lower annual PM2.5 levels (16.4 to 18.8 µg/m³) had similar benefits. Extreme heat was associated with reduced diabetes screening, while PM2.5 showed no significant effect. These findings highlight the need to adapt health service delivery to reduce the impact of heat stress on service utilization. Strategies such as shifting screening services closer to communities, promoting telemedicine, and strengthening the role of primary care and village health volunteers may help maintain access to care during periods of extreme temperature."
Associations Between Environmental Conditions and Infection With Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Japan: A Spatiotemporal Analysis.,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) poses a significant disease burden among children <5 worldwide. Yet systematic analyses of how complex environmental factors are associated with RSV transmission are still lacking in many countries. We introduced a novel 3-stage, data-driven framework to assess the impacts of environmental factors, including meteorological conditions, air pollutants, and extreme weather, on RSV infections from a spatiotemporal perspective. It includes (1) spatiotemporal patterns of RSV transmission; (2) a hierarchical model (HSDLNM) to examine associations between environmental factors and RSV transmission, estimating relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals; and (3) an interpretable machine learning model, Gaussian Process Boosting, to predict RSV infections using historical environmental data. We validated the applicability of the proposed framework in Japan. Weekly data on the number of newly lab-confirmed RSV-positive cases, meteorological factors, and air pollutants were collected from 47 Japanese prefectures (2013-2019). We identified the meteorological thresholds strongly linked to elevated RSV infections, particularly weekly average temperature <10°C (RR, 1.10) or >20°C (RR, 1.13) and weekly average relative humidity <60% (RR, 1.04) or >70% (RR, 1.06). Short-term exposure to particulate matter of 2.5  This study presents the relationships between environmental factors and RSV infections in Japan. Our framework could be applied to areas with similar RSV seasonality to further understand environmental impacts regionally. This research helps inform policy decisions on RSV prophylaxis strategies, supporting cost-effective measures for controlling and preventing early transmission."
Evaluate the impact of PM,"Particulate matter (PM) in air pollution has become a major environmental concern due to its potential health impacts, which vary seasonally and with human activities. While PM is often monitored for concentration, its chemical composition is equally important, especially regarding its effects on the immune system, which remain poorly understood. This study investigates the biological effects of PM2.5 on macrophages collected in different seasons and during COVID-19 restrictions in Taiwan. The experiments revealed significant seasonal variations in metal and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) content in PM2.5, with summer having the highest metal levels and winter the highest PAHs. Exposure to PM2.5 increased cell biotoxicity, correlating with higher PM2.5 concentrations. Further analysis showed that PM2.5 exposure polarized macrophages into the M1 type, triggering inflammatory cytokines, increased ROS levels, cell growth arrest, and apoptosis. Notably, PM2.5 from summer exhibited the highest biotoxicity. The study also identified four metals (Fe, Ti, Co, Sb) as key contributors to biotoxicity. PM2.5 collected during COVID-19 Level 2 Alert showed higher concentrations of these metals, resulting in greater toxicity to macrophages. This research underscores how seasonal changes and human activities influence PM2.5's impact on the immune system, contributing to air pollution control efforts."
Protective effects of natural products against lung damage caused by fine particulate matter.,"A growing body of evidence consistently highlights the substantial risks associated with both acute and chronic exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which significantly increasing the incidence of neurological, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Given that lung health is a critical determinant of overall human well-being, it remains a central focus of medical research. This review investigates the association between PM2.5 exposure and various forms of lung damage, employing both epidemiological and clinical perspectives. Furthermore, the review delves into the molecular mechanisms driving PM2.5-induced lung damage from a toxicological standpoint, with particular attention to oxidative stress, inflammation, and epigenetic modification pathways. A comprehensive review of the literature indicates that natural compounds, including polyphenols, terpenoids, and alkaloids, with known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, could effectively mitigate lung injury, thereby offering promising therapeutic options. This study offers key information into the pathophysiology of PM2.5-related pulmonary diseases and lays the foundation for the development of natural product-based interventions to mitigate lung damage."
Comprehensive insights into the disease burden linked to air pollution exposure across U.S. states: findings from the 2021 Global Burden of Disease Study.,"Ambient air pollution persists as a critical global health threat, ranking fourth among risk factors for premature mortality. Despite decades of air quality improvements in the U.S. through regulatory measures, persistent health impacts remain, driven primarily by particulate matter (PM This study aimed to quantify long-term trends (1990-2021) in air pollution-attributable disease burdens across U.S. states, evaluate the effectiveness of existing policies, and identify priorities for future public health strategies to address persistent and emerging risks. Using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 dataset, we analyzed age-standardized mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years of life lost (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs) attributable to PM From 1990 to 2021, PM"
Assessing the toxicity of traffic-derived air pollution using a primary human air-liquid interface airway in vitro model.,"Traffic-derived air pollution (TDAP) frequently exceeds the 2021 World Health Organization air quality guideline levels and is linked to respiratory diseases through molecular mechanisms such as oxidative stress and inflammation. To determine these mechanisms without relying on animal models and inter-species extrapolation, physiologically relevant human in vitro models are promising tools. We sought to investigate the oxidative stress and inflammatory responses to TDAP in a co-culture model of the human lung. Additionally, we aimed to examine the variability arising from different exposure days and across primary human in vitro models from different donors. Therefore, primary human bronchial epithelial cultures from three donors, each combined with primary alveolar macrophages, were exposed to a continuous flow of ambient TDAP from a high-traffic street in Düsseldorf, Germany on three consecutive days. A versatile aerosol concentration enrichment system was used to increase the fine particulate matter levels from 8 to 42 μg/cm"
"Association between air pollution and non-accidental mortality in Guiyang, China: a time-series analysis (2013-2023).","Air pollution remains one of the leading environmental risk factors for human health globally, significantly contributing to the burden of disease and premature mortality. The relationship between air pollutants and non-accidental deaths in Guiyang was unclear. Descriptive analysis was conducted to characterize air pollutants and mortality trends during the study period. A time-stratified case-crossover design and a quasi-Poisson regression within a generalized additive model (GAM) framework were employed to examine the association between air pollution and mortality. The models incorporated a 7-day lag structure and adjusted for temporal trends, meteorological factors, and day of the week. Analyses were further stratified by cause-specific mortality, age group, sex, and seasonaty as an endpoint for acute health effects, stratified by cause-specific mortality, age, sex and season. SO₂ exposure was associated with a 3.18% (95% CI: 1.95 to 4.42%) increase in excess risk (ER) for non-accidental mortality per 10 μg/m Different pollutants exhibit different lag durations of excess risks and cumulative excess risks for non-accidental mortality and deaths related to circulatory and respiratory systems.

Predictive algorithm for COVID-19 infection risk in indoor environments.,"After the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the deep connections between environmental factors and the transmission of airborne infectious diseases (including COVID-19) has become an area of relevant scientific and social interest. Indoor environments, where we spend a significant part of our daily lives, play a crucial role in shaping the dynamics of disease spread. The mitigation of infection risk related to poor indoor air quality and its link with the transmission of airborne diseases has emerged as a focal point for research and intervention strategies. This paper presents the results of a specific collaborative project in this field, focused on the utilization of Internet of Things (IoT) devices for comprehensive indoor environmental monitoring and infectious risk forecasting.

"Perceived Stress, Residential Indoor PM2.5 Concentration, and Motor Vehicle Traffic Exposure Among Adults with Asthma: A Secondary Analysis.","Poorly controlled asthma creates a multitude of health, financial, and quality of life difficulties. The potential influences of environmental factors on the stress levels of people living with asthma-including exposure to fine particulate matter and motor vehicle traffic-are often overlooked. Among a sample of U.S. adults living with poorly controlled asthma, we aimed to determine (1) differences in perceived stress based on self-reported motor vehicle traffic exposure (MVTE), (2) differences in levels of residential indoor fine particulate matter 2.5 microns or less in diameter (PM2.5) based on self-reported MVTE, and (3) associations between residential indoor PM2.5 and perceived stress. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Symptom Science Model for Environmental Health served as the theoretical basis for this study, which is a secondary analysis of data from an NIH-funded feasibility study that examined the effects of residential indoor air quality on asthma symptoms and lung function in adults with uncontrolled asthma. This secondary analysis included data from the feasibility study's baseline survey of 40 participants and indoor PM2.5 data collected continuously over 14 days. Baseline survey data included demographic data, responses to the modified four-item version of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4), and self-reported data on MVTE (dichotomized as low versus medium/high). Participants were primarily female (90%), White (82.5%), college educated (four-year degree or higher, 77.5%), residents of single-family homes (72.5%) in low-MVTE areas (70%), and 26 to 77 years of age. PSS-4 scores ranged from 0 to 14. Participants reporting medium/high MVTE had higher mean PSS-4 scores than those reporting low MVTE, although the difference was not statistically significant (6.5 versus 5.3, respectively; P = 0.305). The median level of indoor PM2.5 concentration (μg/m3) did not differ significantly regardless of whether the MVTE was medium/high or low (3.2 versus 3.6, respectively; P = 0.836). Higher PSS-4 scores were significantly correlated with higher average indoor PM2.5 levels (r = 0.38, P = 0.017). Indoor PM2.5 reduction has important implications for stress management among adults with asthma. Further research is needed to clarify associations between MVTE and indoor pollution."
A systematic review of the pivotal role of environmental toxicant exposure on infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries.,"The objective of this review is to identify which environmental toxicants are linked to infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) by synthesizing available evidence. It aims to summarize key findings, identify research gaps and provide policy recommendations based on the associations between specific toxicants and disease outcomes. Systematic review. We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science (core collection), and CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library) to identify studies on bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogenic activity. This search yielded 11,468 studies, of which 55 met inclusion criteria after screening following the standard methods. A consistent association is found between particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) exposure and increased respiratory infection risk, with PM2.5 particularly linked to increased incidence and mortality in diseases like COVID-19 and tuberculosis. Heavy metals, including lead, cadmium, and mercury worsen chronic infections such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis by increasing body burden and inflammation. The review highlights air pollutants' substantial impact on infectious disease spread and severity while noting a research gap on other pollutants including persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Bias assessment indicates around half the studies show low risk of bias; however, potential biases were noted in confounding variables and blinding of outcome assessment. The systematic review emphasizes the need for research on biological mechanisms underlying these associations and the impacts of other pollutants. Findings advocate for reducing environmental pollution exposure in LMICs to mitigate infectious disease risk."
The air pollutant PM2.5 aggravates airway inflammation via NF-κB/NLRP3-induced pyroptosis: partially inhibited by the TLR4 inhibitor TAK242.,"Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is believed to be closely connected to asthma severity. However, studies are needed to investigate the underlying mechanism of these findings. Our study attempted to confirm the role of NF-κB/NLRP3 pyroptosis in asthma exacerbation through in vivo and in vitro tests. We also analyzed the differentially expressed genes via RNA-Seq to investigate potential regulatory mechanisms. We undertook in vivo and in vitro research to investigate the effects of PM2.5 on a mouse asthma model and the human bronchial epithelial cell line Beas-2b. Female BALB/c mice were sensitized with OVA to create a murine asthma model. HE staining and the EMAK system were used to assess airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness in mouse lungs. We also measured IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and OVA-specific IgE levels to assess the inflammatory effects of PM2.5 on both normal and OVA-induced asthmatic mice. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to analyze the expression of major NF-κB and pyroptosis proteins. Human bronchial epithelial Beas-2b cells were treated with PM2.5, and the degree of pyroptosis was determined. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was employed to identify differentially expressed genes and investigate potential regulatory mechanisms. In vivo exposure to PM2.5 significantly increased HE staining scores in a mouse model of asthma. The levels of acetylcholine associated with enhanced airway responsiveness were lower in the PM2.5-exposed asthmatic group than in the control group. Compared with the asthmatic group, the BALF group presented considerably greater levels of IL-1β and IL-18. Compared with those in the asthmatic group, the protein expression levels of NLRP3, Caspase-1, GSDMD-N, cleaved Caspase-1p10, IL-1β, and p-NF-κBp65/NF-κBp65 in the lung tissues of the mice in the PM2.5 group were significantly greater than those in the asthmatic group. In vitro, PM2.5 causes pyroptosis and inflammation in Beas-2B human bronchial epithelial cells via the NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway. The TLR4 inhibitor TAK242 can partially block this effect. In the OVA-induced asthma mouse model, PM2.5 activates the NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway and induces pyroptosis, thereby exacerbating airway inflammation and hyperreactivity. It may activate the NF-κB signalling cascade through the TLR4/MyD88 pathway, upregulate critical proteins in the pyroptosis pathway, and induce pyroptosis and inflammation in respiratory epithelial Beas-2b cells, exacerbating asthma."

Critical exposure windows of PM2.5-Meteorological interactions triggering pediatric mycoplasma pneumoniae epidemics: An age-stratified distributed lag nonlinear modeling approach.,"The rising prevalence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection (MPI) in children, a leading cause of severe pneumonia and mortality, highlights the need to clarify impacts of air pollution and meteorological factors. This study analyzed associations of PM2.5, temperature, and humidity with outpatient MPI, inpatient MPP, and severe MPP (SMPP). Data on 391,559 children from 15 Northeast China hospitals (2017-2023) were analyzed using a distributed lag nonlinear model, with sensitivity analysis after 2020 (COVID-19 onset). PM2.5 (60-100 μg/m High PM2.5, high temperature, and extreme humidity correlate with increased childhood MPI cases and severity, emphasizing targeted strategies for extreme conditions."
A study on the correlation between regional airborne particulate concentration and asthma occurrence based on an open database and time series prediction.,"Air pollution has become an issue of concern in recent years. The rapid development of modern technology and industrial carbon emissions has led to an increase in suspended particles in the air. This is of particular concern in Taiwan, where the focus on high-tech industries, whether semiconductor manufacturing or printed circuit board manufacturing, produces pollutants that are harmful to the environment. Asthma is an important issue both in the past and today. The clinical care guidelines for adult asthma issued in 2022 state that the prevalence of asthma in Taiwan was 12% for adults and 15% for children. Based on these estimates, there are approximately 2 million asthma patients in Taiwan, which creates a serious burden on healthcare resources. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between regional airborne particles and asthma, to determine which airborne particles are most associated with asthma, and to ascertain the degree of correlation between the two through the statistical method of correlation analysis. A weak positive correlation was found between PM10 and the number of asthma emergencies. A time series model was also used to predict PM2.5 and PM10 levels and the number of asthma emergencies, which can be used as a reference for the number of asthma consultations and as a basis for evaluating the allocation of healthcare resources."
A post-pandemic analysis of air pollution over small-sized urban areas in southern Thailand following the COVID-19 lockdown.,"COVID-19 has been a pandemic with paramount effects on human health that brought about a noticeable improvement of air quality due to a reduction of anthropogenic activities. While studying this phenomenon in large cities has been a popular research topic, related research on smaller-sized urban areas has not been given the necessary attention. In the current study, we focus on the period during and after the COVID-19 pandemic over 8 small- and medium-sized urban areas in southern Thailand and present the effect of the lockdown on the air quality as quantified by the Sentinel-5P satellite and regulatory-grade surface stations over the years 2020, 2021 and 2022. Findings indicate that there is a noticeable reduction of -14%, -24% and -28% for NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 surface concentrations, respectively, for all the 8 urban areas cumulatively for the 2-month period following the lockdown, while results for O3 were inconclusive. An alignment between the ground and satellite observations is noticed, despite their difference in spatial scales and measuring different physical characteristics. Regression analysis between the single-pixel values over the ground station locations and the spatially-averaged pixels over the urban extent indicates an agreement between these two features, suggesting that single measurements can be representative of the air pollution status for relatively small-sized urban areas."
Urbanization and childhood asthma.,"Childhood asthma is one of the major public health concerns, and urbanization as well as worsening environmental factors are contributing to its increasing prevalence. Outdoor pollutants, such as PM2.5, ozone, and traffic-related air pollution or TRAP, play significant roles in exacerbating asthmatic symptoms in children as well as reducing their lung function. Climate change can further compound these effects with changing pollen patterns that increase exposure to allergens in certain geographical areas. Moreover, indoor environments in urban areas also expose children to pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, and aeroallergens like cockroach or mouse allergens. Socioeconomic disparities can further amplify these effects, with children in minority or low-income households disproportionately burdened by asthma morbidity. Green infrastructure and technological innovations can offer mitigation opportunities for negative effects of urbanization but require careful implementation to address multifactorial contributors to childhood asthma. Our review highlights the need for integrated strategies regarding environmental regulation, urban planning, and targeted interventions to reduce asthma burden in the urban pediatric population."
Astragaloside II pretreatment alleviates PM2.5-induced lung injury in mice via MAPK/Nrf2/GPX4 axis-mediated suppression of ferroptosis.,"Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) induces inflammation and oxidative stress, contributing to respiratory diseases, including lung injury. Astragaloside II (AS II), a natural product derived from Astragali Radix (AR), demonstrates dual anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. This work systematically evaluates AS II's prophylactic efficacy and molecular pathways in mitigating PM2.5-triggered pulmonary damage using a murine model. Intratracheal PM2.5 suspension (7.5 mg/kg) was applied, with AS II (25 and 50 mg/kg) pretreated via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection before the pollutant challenge. Results demonstrated that AS II alleviated PM2.5-induced lung injury, mitigated pulmonary edema and inflammation, and reduced levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β). AS II upregulated glutathione (GSH) and catalase (CAT) levels while downregulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Mechanistically, AS II inhibited the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway, activated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), enhanced expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and elevated other antioxidant proteins while suppressing ferroptosis and oxidative stress markers. To further validate the role of ferroptosis, RSL3-a small-molecule ferroptosis agonist that binds and inactivates GPX4-was employed. The protective efficacy of AS II against lung injury was effectively counteracted by RSL3-induced GPX4 inactivation. Collectively, AS II protects against PM2.5-induced pulmonary injury by modulating the MAPK/NRF2/GPX4 signaling axis to inhibit ferroptosis, thereby providing a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PM2.5-associated pulmonary diseases."
Source apportionment and dynamics of PM,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was reported to improve air quality. However, the effects of lockdown on PM₂.₅ and its chemical components based on source-specific characteristics remain unclear. This study evaluated and compared the components of PM₂.₅ across three target sites-Seoul, Ansan-Siheung, and Wonju-based on source distribution patterns during the pandemic and post-pandemic periods. The results revealed that total ion concentrations decreased by 7-19% at the target sites, while trace element concentrations increased by 19-29% in the post-pandemic period. Carbon concentrations showed region-specific trends. Components associated with secondary formation, such as SO₄²⁻, NO₃⁻, and NH₄⁺, decreased, whereas natural-origin components, such as Cl⁻, Na⁺, Mg²⁺, and Ca²⁺, increased, indicating enhanced dust resuspension. Furthermore, a positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis demonstrated a predominance of primary emission sources and resuspended dust in the post-pandemic period, with a decline in contributions from secondary formation sources. These regional variations were primarily influenced by the extent of socioeconomic activities, with Seoul exhibiting a higher contribution from primary emissions and suspended dust. This study emphasizes the importance of establishing region-specific air quality improvement policies by scientifically identifying the impacts of anthropogenic activity on PM₂.₅ components and their sources."
Association Between US Wildfires and Health Care Utilization for Acute Rhinosinusitis.,"Wildfires (WF), a major contributor to air pollution including ambient particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), have been shown to increase the risk of developing sinonasal diseases. This study assesses the impact of WF on health care claims for acute rhinosinusitis (ARS). Utilizing national WF geospatial records and EPA-based smoke-PM2.5 databases, we identified core-based statistical areas (CBSAs) affected by WF >50,000 acres, occurring between 2014 and 2019. We correlated WF events with MarketScan health care claims data, calculating daily outpatient visit proportions relative to total visits per CBSA for ARS, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), rhinitis, and asthma. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) by comparing visit proportions in pre-WF versus post-WF periods, adjusted for seasonality by comparison to non-WF periods in the same CBSAs. Cross-correlation (CC) analysis was conducted to determine the temporal relationship between daily smoke-PM2.5 and ARS-visit proportions. Sixteen WFs events from nine CBSAs were captured, yielding 2.22 M claims. ARS visit proportions increased in the 2 months post-WF periods, with an RR of 1.17 (confidence interval = 1.12‒1.22). CRS and rhinitis showed no significant increase in RR. Control analysis (2.08 M claims) yielded an RR of 0.97 (0.93‒1.082) for non-WF ARS-visit proportions. CC analysis indicated a significant correlation (0.4 ± 0.04; p < 0.001) with a lag of 33 ± 3 days. WF smoke exposure is associated with increased health care utilization for ARS in the 2 months post-exposure."
The impact of ambient air pollution and meteorological factors on emergency hospital admissions of COPD patients in Poland (2012-2019).,"The relations between ambient air pollution, meteorological factors, and the number of emergency hospital admissions due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were analyzed. The study utilized a nationwide collection of emergency hospital admissions from anonymous public registries covering the period of 8 years (2012-2019). Separated analyses were presented by sex, age group, and place of residence (rural vs. urban area), a group of major pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO"
The effects of long-term co-exposure to nanocarbon black particles and benzo[a]pyrene on ROS levels and the AKT/P27 signaling pathway in BEAS-2B cells.,"Long-term co-exposure to nanocarbon black particles (NCBP) and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), as major components of PM2.5, may contribute to respiratory diseases by inducing oxidative damage. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their synergistic effects remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the impact of long-term co-exposure to NCBP and B[a]P on reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and the protein kinase B (AKT)/cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (P27) signaling pathway in human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) cells. Cytotoxicity concentrations of NCBP and B[a]P for BEAS-2B cells were screened using the cell counting kit-8 assay and applied to subsequent long-term exposure experiments. Intracellular ROS levels were measured via fluorescent probe assay. Western blot was performed to analyze the expression of AKT/P27 pathway-related proteins (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phosphorylated AKT [p-AKT], total AKT, and P27). The regulatory relationship between the pathway and P27 was validated using an AKT inhibitor, and statistical analysis was conducted to evaluate significance. Significant reductions in cell viability (P < .05) were observed at concentrations of 16 μM B[a]P and 80 μg/mL NCBP. Long-term co-exposure to NCBP and B[a]P-induced ROS accumulation (P < .05). Western blot revealed upregulated p-AKT expression (P < .05) and significant suppression of P27 (P < .05) in the co-exposure group. Inhibition of p-AKT by an AKT inhibitor reversed the downregulation of P27 induced by co-exposure (P < .05), indicating that P27 is a downstream target of the AKT pathway. Compared to single exposures, co-exposure exhibited stronger synergistic effects on oxidative stress dysregulation. Long-term co-exposure to NCBP and B[a]P exacerbates oxidative damage in BEAS-2B cells by activating the AKT signaling pathway, suppressing P27 expression, and promoting ROS accumulation. This study elucidates potential mechanisms of multi-pollutant synergistic effects, providing new insights for health risk assessment of environmental co-exposure."
Particulate Matter 2.5 Induces FGFR1-mediated Integrin Switch to Promote Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Metastasis.,"Particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) is known to adversely affect human health. While its involvement in lung cancer pathogenesis is recognized, its specific impact on metastasis-related behaviors of lung cancer cells remains largely unexplored. In this study, we employed cell culture models, proteomic analysis, and bioinformatic analysis. Target proteins and signaling pathways were validated using western blotting and immunofluorescence assay. Wound healing, transwell migration and phalloidin-rhodamine assays were used to determine the migratory activity. Proteomic analysis identified 3,795 proteins in both control and PM2.5-treated groups. Among these, proteins associated with metastasis, particularly those related to ""cell migration"" (GO: 0016477), were highlighted, identifying six key proteins involved in cancer metastasis. Protein-protein interaction analysis pinpointed fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) as a central target influenced by PM2.5, which promoted cell migration  These results indicate that FGFR1 is a crucial target in PM2.5-induced metastasis in lung cancer cells, operating through an FGFR1/integrin/Akt signaling axis. This study advances our understanding of the role of PM2.5 in lung cancer metastasis and suggests potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate cancer progression."
Effect of exposure to ambient particulate matter on risk of developing pulmonary tuberculosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health challenge, particularly in polluted areas. The relationship between ambient particulate matter and TB risk remains unclear, making this systematic review and meta-analysis (SRMA) vital for assessing this link. This SRMA aimed to estimate the association between exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and the risk of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) infection. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane (English-language studies) on January 29, 2024. The review followed PRISMA Guidelines (2020) for comprehensive literature searches, data extraction, and quality assessment of included studies. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis to estimate pooled effect sizes and assess heterogeneity. Study quality and publication bias were also evaluated. Of the 507 articles identified, 25 met the inclusion criteria. Long-term PM2.5 exposure was linked to a 26% increase in PTB risk (RR =1.26, 95% CI: 1.07-1.48), while short-term exposure raised the risk by 10% (RR =1.10, 95% CI: 0.98-1.25). Long-term PM10 exposure increased PTB risk by 7% (RR =1.07, 95% CI: 1.02-1.12), with short-term exposure showing a similar increase (RR =1.07, 95% CI: 0.95-1.17). Subgroup analysis revealed PTB risk increased by 15% in males and 29% in females for PM2.5, and by 10% in males and 7% in females for PM10. A 10 µg/m³ increase in Particulate matter is associated with a higher risk of pulmonary tuberculosis, highlighting the need for targeted public health measures to reduce particulate exposure, especially in high-risk urban and industrial areas."

Global burden of disease study on COPD in the older adult: comprehensive analysis of environmental factors and interaction effects.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading global health issue, ranking fourth in mortality in 2021 per GBD 2021, with older adults most at risk due to aging-related vulnerabilities. Environmental factors like air pollution and temperature extremes are key contributors, with evidence suggesting their interaction worsens COPD. As the older adult population is projected to reach 2.1 billion by 2050, understanding these impacts is vital for public health. Using GBD 2021 data, we analyzed COPD burden in older adults (1990-2021) due to air pollution and non-optimal temperature. Joinpoint regression and Bayesian models assessed trends in age-standardized mortality (ASMR) and disability-adjusted life year (ASDR) rates globally, regionally, and nationally. Spearman's correlation evaluated socio-demographic index (SDI) associations, and standardized exposure value (SEV) data examined air pollution-temperature interactions. Globally, most environmental COPD burdens declined or stabilized, but high temperature burdens rose (AAPC > 0,  This study reveals shifting COPD burdens, with ambient PM2.5 and high temperatures emerging as key challenges, particularly in lower-SDI areas. Synergistic air pollution-temperature effects highlight the need for integrated policies. These findings support targeted interventions to reduce COPD burden and enhance health equity in aging populations."
High-resolution mapping of residential wood burning heat sources using Energy Performance Certificates: A case study of England and Wales.,"Particulate matter emissions from residential wood burning are rising in many countries. Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter is strongly linked with adverse health effects including cardiovascular and respiratory disease. Policymakers and scientists need accurate tools to identify residential wood burning hotspots. However, current methods rely on spatially-misaligned, out-of-date data sources, reducing their practical utility and portability to other contexts. Furthermore, the socio-economic characteristics of residential wood burning in high income countries are poorly understood. We used open data from 26 million Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) for properties in England and Wales from 2009-2025 to map the concentration and prevalence of wood burners within small areas. We evaluated our method against the UK national wood burning emissions inventory using national air pollution monitoring networks. We used novel open data linkages to characterise associations between area-level prevalence of wood burners and socio-economic factors including deprivation, ethnicity, and age. We identified substantial spatial heterogeneity in the concentration of wood burners, with the highest concentrations in affluent urban areas. Our concentration metric was more strongly correlated with peaks in winter PM2.5 at urban monitoring sites than estimates from the UK national emissions inventory. Prevalence of wood burners was positively correlated with age and negatively correlated with measures of social deprivation. Prevalence of wood burners in EPCs has increased since 2009. EPCs are a valuable data source which policymakers can use to target local interventions or extend existing restrictions on solid fuel burning. Our method is transparent, up-to-date, and portable to other countries where similar EPC data is available. The relationship between social deprivation and prevalence of wood burning heat sources highlights important issues of environmental justice. Epidemiological analyses of wood smoke exposures and health should carefully account for the confounding effects of age, deprivation, and ethnicity."
